    "I recently fed one of my Princeton tour reflections into a small chain of language models, partly out of curiosity and partly out of mischief. What happens if the same paragraph gets summarized, expanded, and re-summarized by different AIs in multiple rounds? Will the meaning stay intact, or will it quietly drift into something I never said? Would it make up the names that I never mentioned in my decription? It’s essentially the old “telephone game,” just played by neural networks instead of children at a birthday party.\n",

    "The writing paragraph for test from my [travel blog](https://hanxi-guo.github.io/comm4190_F25_Using_LLMs_Blog/posts/015_travel_blog/princeton.html)  : My first stop was Nassau Hall. I walked slowly along the old stone walls, leaves crunching under my shoes. It’s fall now, and the trees have turned a deep golden hue. Everything felt calm, almost ceremonial. Emerald ivy clung to the walls as if it had been growing there for centuries, maybe that’s why we call princeton as one of ivy league😉? The bronze tigers lay quietly by the entrance, and the American flag waved gently above the doorway. There was a sense of quiet, timeless strength in the air. At Cannon Green, a gentle breeze drifted by, and sunlight filtered softly through the gaps between the leaves. A few students were eating sandwiches, some half-talking, half-dozing in the warmth. I didn’t know anyone, but I felt completely at ease, immersed and relaxed.\n",

    "During my autumn visit to Princeton University, Nassau Hall stood as a majestic centerpiece amid nature's seasonal transformation. Golden leaves carpeted the grounds while emerald ivy clung to the historic building's weathered façade, creating a scene worthy of a postcard. The bronze tigers guarding the entrance remained in silent vigil, their stoic presence adding to the hall's dignified atmosphere. Above, the American flag gently undulated in the breeze, its rhythmic movement emphasizing rather than disturbing the prevailing tranquility.\n",

    "As I wandered to Cannon Green, dappled sunlight filtered through the canopy of trees, casting intricate patterns across the lawn where students lounged and studied. Though I was there as a solitary visitor, I experienced no sense of isolation or awkwardness. Instead, I found myself completely at ease, absorbed in the peaceful ambiance that seemed to transcend time. The campus exuded a ceremonial quietude—a timeless strength that invited contemplation and offered a respite from the hurried pace of everyday life.\n",

    "## Takeaway\n",
    "Somewhere along the AI relay race, my crunchy leaves, drowsy sandwich-eaters, and politely reclining bronze tigers vanished, and they were, unfortunatly, replaced by lofty words about “reflection” and “escape.” The personal texture quietly dissolved, and the final version sounded less like me walking around Princeton and more like Princeton writing its own brochure. This may be because personal travel notes are far less common in its training data than polished institutional language, so when the models rewrite each other, the messy, specific, human bits are the first to disappear. In other words, the more the models rewrote each other, the more the lived moment was smoothed out into something “elegant” but less authentically mine.\n",
