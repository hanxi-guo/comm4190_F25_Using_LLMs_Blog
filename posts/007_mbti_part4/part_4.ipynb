    "Welcome back to When AI Meets MBTI! So far in Parts 1–3, we’ve played three games: spotting personality in AI replies, guessing types without labels, and pushing GPT to cosplay as any MBTI you like. If you haven't seen them, click here]Now we turn aroud into another question: are humans happier chatting with AI that matches their own MBTI type, or one that’s their complementary opposite? In other words: do you want an AI therapist or an AI chaos twin? Let’s run a quick mini-survey and find out!\n",
    "\n",
    "> For this part of the series, I used ChatGPT-5 as the model. The “personality types” you’ll see are not real traits of the system, but styles that I prompted it to adopt (or that readers later interpreted). This is not a strict psychological study—it’s a playful survey and thought experiment\n"
