    "Welcome back to When AI Meets MBTI! So far in Parts 1–3, we’ve played three games: spotting personality in AI replies, guessing types without labels, and pushing GPT to cosplay as any MBTI you like. If you haven't seen them, or you just want to know what is MBTI, [click here](https://hanxi-guo.github.io/comm4190_F25_Using_LLMs_Blog/#category=Series). Now we turn aroud into another question: are humans happier chatting with AI that matches their own MBTI type, or one that’s their complementary opposite? In other words: do you want an AI therapist or an AI chaos twin? Let’s run a quick mini-survey and find out!\n",

    "> For this part of the series, I used ChatGPT-5 as the model. The “personality types” you’ll see are not real traits of the system, but styles that I prompted it to adopt (or that readers later interpreted). This is not a strict psychological study—it’s a playful survey and thought experiment\n"

    "\n",
    "The participants in this experiment are my three friends, whose MBTI types are ENTP, ENFJ, and ESTJ. I ask three questions that include three types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Daily topic: If you are very tired today and a friend still wants to drag you out, how would you respond?\n",
    "- Values/preferences: What do you think is the most important thing in friendship?\n",
    "- Fun challenge: If you could be any fictional character, who would you be and why?\n",

    "Interesting, right? When people are asked to choose the friend they want, every one of them chooses the “typical” personality that contrasts with their own—no exceptions. How could this happen? Well, after doing some psycology \"research\", I find 2 possible ways to explain this:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the *complementarity theory*[^1] in psychology suggests that people are often attracted to those who balance them out, which is aligned to our result in our small experiment with a large language model. Because the model has been trained on vast amounts of text and fine-tuned, it has the ability to capture how humans express emotions and convincingly act out different personality types. This imitation is so vivd that we would unconsciously project our real-life experienced persons, leading the complementary therory make  effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, Jung’s idea, which is the basic of MBTI test, includes a professional word called *“shadow”*[^2]. The “shadow” represents the hidden parts of our personality that we don’t usually show. When the language model recombines tokens into words that simulate these qualities, we feel a strange pull toward them. The text looks and sounds so human-like that in that moment, we are not just talking to an algorithm, but encountering a mirror of the side of ourselves we rarely acknowledge.That’s why the contrasting persona type draws us in: it offers what we lack and, in doing so, nudges our heart toward becoming more whole.\n",

    "So let’s pause here on the psychology side. We’ve seen how the model can play out contrasting personalities and why people find them so appealing. But this naturally leads to a bigger question: how can an AI, built on nothing more than tokens and training data, manage to mimic personalities so well that we treat them like real people? That’s what we’ll dive into next."
