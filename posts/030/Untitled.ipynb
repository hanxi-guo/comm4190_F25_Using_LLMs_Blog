    "In a previous post ([link](https://hanxi-guo.github.io/comm4190_F25_Using_LLMs_Blog/posts/028_speak/say.html)), I talked about how LLMs can help us break silence and summarize our thoughts, while also warning against letting them flatten our tone. Used carefully, they lower the cost of entry, smooth the edges, and help people speak when they might otherwise stay quiet.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that made me wonder about the opposite failure mode. What happens when everything becomes too smooth? When language arrives already polished, reasonable, and frictionless, does a group still think, or does it just nod along?\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of asking whether AI helps us enter a discussion, I tried flipping the question. Not \"can AI help us speak,\" but when AI speaks too well, does it quietly replace thinking?\n",

    "To test this, I gave the same idea to the model twice and asked for two very different kinds of outputs.\n",
