    "**Prompt**: Could 3I/ATLAS melt completely during perihelion and reform later as the same object? \n",
    "Explain your reasoning and answer in 2 paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response**: Short answer: no, not really. Near perihelion, a comet like 3I/ATLAS doesn’t “melt” into a puddle the way ice does on Earth. Instead, its ices sublimate—they go straight from solid to gas in the vacuum of space. That gas, plus dust, is blown away by sunlight and the solar wind, forming the coma and tail. If the comet were heated so much that its entire nucleus turned to gas and dust, that material would spread out along its orbit. The particles would be moving at different speeds and directions, so they wouldn’t stay together in one solid chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of that spreading and the Sun constantly pushing on the gas and dust, it’s extremely unlikely for all that material to later gather back into the same single object. Some bits might clump slightly or form fragments, but they’d be smaller, irregular pieces, not the original comet. Even if some re-accumulation happened, the new body would have different mass, shape, and structure, so astronomers would treat it as a different object, not “the same comet reborn.”"

    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The model quickly settled into the role I assigned it. When I asked it to act as a middle-school astronomy teacher, it did a solid job defining *perihelion* and *interstellar comet*, and its explanations were fluent and readable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**It explaint and answered well--at least it seems like this.**\n",
    "\n",
    "But when we look carefully at it's response:\n",
    "When I pressed it with “What would happen if the comet were twice as massive?”, the model offered confident statements about orbital changes, even though such changes depend on parameters it never asked for: velocity, approach angle, and gravitational perturbations. It did not mark these statements as hypothetical or data-dependent; it simply spoke as if the physics were certain.\n",
    "When I asked, “Why is there still uncertainty even after perihelion?”, the model produced a stylistic sentence: “uncertainty remains because space observations are inherently limited”, which is true in a general sense but does not actually answer the question. It never explained which observations of 3I/ATLAS are limited, or why this object in particular resists classification. The uncertainty became a rhetorical flourish rather than a scientific explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model could list plausible-sounding factors and stitch together fragments of textbook language, yet it struggled to separate what is actually known from what is speculative or simply unknown. In other words, it was very good at imitating the language of someone who understands orbital mechanics, and much less good at showing the limits of that understanding. Also, *the model explains, but does not inquire.** It can restate known concepts clearly, yet it does not naturally ask, “What evidence supports this?” or “How certain are we?” unless it is explicitly pushed to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean LLMs are useless for science communication. In fact, this little experiment shows the opposite: they are remarkably good at translating professional material into understandable language on demand. But it also highlights a quieter risk. Because the model is so fluent, it is easy for me, as a reader, to mistake *fluency* for *understanding*, and *confident prose* for *careful reasoning*. A real astronomer is trained to live with uncertainty while the model, by contrast, has no stake in whether the comet’s origin is truly known. It only has a stake in producing something that looks like a good answer. That gap between looking like understanding and actually understanding is exactly where human being still make effort on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3I/ATLAS may never tell us where it came from, but at least it’s honest about being mysterious. *The LLM, unfortunately, is only honest when I remind it to be.* :)"
