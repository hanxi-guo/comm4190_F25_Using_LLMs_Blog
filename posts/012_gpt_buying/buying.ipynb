    "Recently, OpenAI released a new feature in ChatGPT called Instant Checkout. In theory, it lets you buy something without ever leaving the chat.  The funtcion is sound futuristic enough: why open another tab when you can let an AI handle your wallet for you?  But this the kind of feature is also slightly unsettling, like a friend who remembers your credit card number a little too well.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I decided to run a small experiment. I wasn’t trying to test how efficient it was. What I really wanted to see was how human it felt. Would this feature truly create a better shopping experience, or would it simply turn us into better trained consumers who spend money faster?\n",
