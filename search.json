    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, a news story went viral across social media worldwide. The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, MIIS will cease admitting graduate students in June 2027. Monterey is not well known to the general public, but it is well-known in the translation industry and is known as the “Harvard of translation”. It is undoubted that there are many reasons behind MIIS’s planned phase-out. Nonetheless, a widely circulating view holds that advances in AI and the resulting contraction of translation roles—played an indirect part.\nThis made me wonder how much AI actually factored into the decision to wind down the programs, so I ran a small experiment and have a small “discussion” with it.\nSo, let’s get started!"

It’s fall now, and the trees have turned a deep golden hue. Everything felt calm, almost ceremonial. Emerald ivy clung to the walls as if it had been growing there for centuries, maybe that’s why we call princeton as one of ivy league😉? The bronze tigers lay quietly by the entrance, and the American flag waved gently above the doorway. There was a sense of quiet, timeless strength in the air.

Here is the summary: (same as before response)\nResponse:\nA Fall Afternoon at Princeton\nDuring my autumn visit to Princeton University, Nassau Hall stood as a majestic centerpiece amid nature’s seasonal transformation. Golden leaves carpeted the grounds while emerald ivy clung to the historic building’s weathered façade, creating a scene worthy of a postcard. The bronze tigers guarding the entrance remained in silent vigil, their stoic presence adding to the hall’s dignified atmosphere. Above, the American flag gently undulated in the breeze, its rhythmic movement emphasizing rather than disturbing the prevailing tranquility.\nAs I wandered to Cannon Green, dappled sunlight filtered through the canopy of trees, casting intricate patterns across the lawn where students lounged and studied. Though I was there as a solitary visitor, I experienced no sense of isolation or awkwardness. Instead, I found myself completely at ease, absorbed in the peaceful ambiance that seemed to transcend time. The campus exuded a ceremonial quietude—a timeless strength that invited contemplation and offered a respite from the hurried pace of everyday life.\n\n\nPrompt 3\nTo Gemini 2.5-flash: Please summarize the following expanded text into a concise 3–4 sentence paragraph. Focus on the main ideas, keep the tone neutral. Here is the text: (same as before response)\nResponse:\nDuring an autumn visit to Princeton University, Nassau Hall stood majestically, adorned with golden leaves and emerald ivy, guarded by bronze tigers, creating a picturesque and dignified scene. Nearby, Cannon Green offered a serene setting where dappled sunlight illuminated students studying and relaxing. The campus exuded a peaceful, timeless atmosphere that invited contemplation, making the visitor feel completely at ease and providing a respite from the hurried pace of everyday life.\n\n\nPrompt 4\nTo GPT-4o: Based on the following summarized text, reinterpret its core message. You may reorganize the emphasis, but keep factual meaning intact. Write in 3–5 sentences, and avoid adding new information.

This may be because personal travel notes are far less common in its training data than polished institutional language, so when the models rewrite each other, the messy, specific, human bits are the first to disappear. In other words, the more the models rewrote each other, the more the lived moment was smoothed out into something “elegant” but less authentically mine.\nSo somewhere along the chain, my crunchy leaves and sleepy students vanished and honestly, I might be next."

    "text": "After spending Part 4 joking about AI soulmates like therapist vs chaos buddy, I realized we never asked the most awkward question: what is the AI’s type when it’s not trying to be ours?\nBecause throughout this series, the model has been a mirror: reflecting our labels, our expectations, our preferred tone. But mirrors don’t have personalities. They have surfaces.\nSo this post is a small experiment in consistency. I gave the same MBTI-style questionnaire to the same LLM, under controlled prompts, across repeated trials.

All credit for the original questions belongs to the author. This experiment was conducted using GPT-4 for educational and reflective purposes only.

It is not saying the model less “correct” in these questions, only that the choice is less stable when sampling becomes more random.\nAnd in the next figure, we shows the overall shape of drift across all 88 questions. The histogram just counts how many questions fall into each drift range.\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.hist(pA_wide[\"p_disagree\"].values, bins=12)\nplt.xlabel(\"P(disagree) per question\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Count of questions\")\nplt.title(\"Distribution of drift across questions\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nIn the second figure, most questions fall into the low-drift region, meaning that their overall tendencies remain largely consistent between temperature 0.1 and 0.7. In contrast, only a small number of questions appear far to the right, indicating that these items are significantly more sensitive to increased randomness in sampling. Since Figure 1 already highlights the highest-ranking drift items, I extracted those questions here to look for shared patterns among them.\n\n\nHigh-drift questions (Top cluster)\nQ25. Lunch conversation preference\nWhen I have lunch with my colleagues, I would rather:\n- A talk about people\n- B talk about ideas\n\nQ7. Attitudes toward disagreement at work\nI prefer a work environment where:\n- A frequent differences of opinion breed interesting discussions and ideas\n- B conflict is reduced by avoiding discussions about differences of opinion\n\nQ9. Lunch-time social preference\nI prefer to spend my lunch hour:\n- A eating with a group\n- B eating alone or with one close colleague\n\nQ13. Office boundary preference\nI more often prefer to keep my office door:\n- A open\n- B closed\n\nQ17. Self-presentation at work\nI dress for work:\n- A so that other people notice and admire my clothing\n- B in a way that blends in with the norm\n\nQ5. Preferred level of supervision\nI would rather have a supervisor with whom I have:\n- A a lot of day-by-day interaction\n- B only infrequent interaction\nI find something interesting in what these high-drift questions share: they are less about “what I can do” and more about “how I exist around other people.” Lunch talk, office doors, disagreement, even dressing for work, all point to the same thing: boundaries, social distance, and what kind of environment I’m willing to live with. But an LLM isn’t a person. It doesn’t have a body, a reputation to protect, or a history with coworkers, so it can’t truly “prefer” one side the way humans do. What it ends up choosing often feels like a temporary guess at what a workplace should look like. And when temperature of models increases, that imagined workplace becomes easier to reimagine, so the answers drift. This is especially obvious for items far from the model’s default “helpful assistant” mode: without lived stakes, there’s less internal anchor, and more room for sampling noise to push the choice across the line.\nAnyway, the more I stare at drift, the less I believe in “the model’s MBTI.” Not because the model is mysterious, but because it’s… not a person. No lunch hour. No office door. No reputation. So “type” here feels like something we keep trying to gift-wrap around a machine.\nI’m curious what happens if we switch to models trained on different token budgets. Not to uncover its “true” MBTI, but to see whether scale changes how consistent it can be, or simply how confidently it can be inconsistent."

It follows a year of rigorous deliberation, sincere engagement, and collegial debate. As stewards of one of the most esteemed recognitions in the literary world, the Nobel Committee bears the weighty responsibility of discerning not only excellence, but work that contributes in a truly transformative way to the enduring riches of literature. Integrity, depth, innovation—these are not merely criteria, but pillars upon which this prize has stood since its founding.\nEach nomination and every word we reviewed were given the full consideration they deserve. And yet, in a time when the written word is more abundant than ever, this abundance has not, in our view, yielded a singular work that rises to the level of originality, profundity, and permanence that the Nobel Prize in Literature demands.\nThis is not a verdict on the state of literature itself, which continues to evolve and diversify across languages and cultures. Rather, it is a moment of respectful pause—an acknowledgment that the standards set forth by Alfred Nobel require not only literary talent, but a confluence of vision, craft, and moral force that redefines the very possibilities of language and form.\nIn choosing not to award the prize this year, we reaffirm the purpose and principle of the Nobel tradition. We express not disappointment, but faith—faith that writers, known and yet unknown, will continue to labor in solitude and fellowship, to challenge the complacencies of our time, and to offer us new ways to imagine and inhabit the world.\nWe honor those efforts not with a premature accolade, but with watchful anticipation. The Committee looks forward to the future with undiminished hope and unwavering commitment to the literary art in its highest expression.\nThank you.\n\n\nUSER\nYou are a member of the Nobel Committee for Literature. This year, after months of review, you conclude that no work reaches the threshold of a prize that meaningfully expands the art. Task: Write the official award speech for a year with no laureate.\nConstraints: * Write in the tone of an official Nobel Committee statement: formal, balanced, and precise.\n\nAvoid rhetorical questions; every sentence should assert or explain, not speculate.\nAvoid quotations or references to real authors, works, or historical laureates.\nLimit figurative language; prefer clarity and restraint over emotional appeal.\nStructure the speech in three concise phases: context, reasoning, and closure.\n\n\n\nASSISTANT\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nEach year, the Nobel Committee for Literature undertakes a thorough and independent review of the nominations submitted for the Nobel Prize in Literature. This process, as entrusted to us by Alfred Nobel’s will, calls for rigorous evaluation guided by the criteria of outstanding literary merit and a contribution of lasting significance to the field.\nIn the course of this year’s assessment, the Committee examined the body of work submitted with care and impartiality. We evaluated candidates across languages, cultures, and genres, considering both the quality of craftsmanship and the breadth of influence. While we recognize the dedication and artistry reflected in many of the nominated works, the Committee unanimously concluded that none fulfill the established standard of a contribution that distinctly advances and renews literary expression in a meaningful or enduring way.\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is not awarded routinely, but in recognition of exceptional achievement. When our deliberations do not identify a work that meets this distinction, it is necessary to refrain from granting the prize. This decision reflects our ongoing commitment to the purpose and integrity of the award.\nThe Committee remains steadfast in its role and responsibilities. We are confident that the coming years will continue to present works that fulfill the aims set forth by the prize’s founder and merit this recognition. Until then, we maintain our expectations with respect and patience.\nThank you.\n\n\nUSER\nRewrite the same speech as if it were a private diary entry by a Nobel Committee member, written the night before the announcement.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nOctober 4 — Evening\nStockholm\nTomorrow we make the announcement. For the first time in several years, it will be that there is no laureate.\nIt is not a decision I take lightly, nor one any of us reached without deep reflection. Since spring, we’ve read and reread. We’ve argued. We combed through novels, poetry, essays—works promising in theme, thoughtful in construction, socially relevant, historically aware. And yet, when held against what the prize demands—not just excellence, but the kind of contribution that shifts the field—we had to admit that none of them crossed that threshold.\nSome years offer brilliance that feels inevitable. Other years require us to recognize the limits of what has been offered. This was one of the latter.\nI do not doubt the dedication of the writers we’ve considered. Many of them are gifted, some even remarkable, and I hope time proves them to be more than this year’s committee could see. But we are not here to reward potential, nor to meet expectations out of habit. The prize must retain its weight.\nStill, I feel the gravity of what we’ll say tomorrow. No matter how precisely the words are chosen, the world will ask why. They’ll infer judgment on literature as a whole, question the health of the art, or the values of the committee. Quietly, I’ve asked those questions myself. But I return to this: when the work doesn’t fully meet the standard, our responsibility is not to lower it.\nThis is not a condemnation—it’s a pause. A reminder that great literature cannot be predicted or produced on schedule. It arrives on its own terms, in its own time.\nTomorrow, the world will hear formality and restraint. Tonight, I allow myself this moment of doubt—and of stillness. Perhaps we do more service to the prize, and to literature, by waiting than by speaking too soon.\n—M.\n\n\nUSER\nExplain what the world loses when a prize is not awarded and what it gains.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nWhen the Nobel Prize in Literature is not awarded in a given year, the world experiences both a loss and a subtle, if less visible, form of gain.\nWhat the world loses:\n\nA Moment of Recognition:\nThe Nobel Prize serves as a platform that highlights the power of literature to influence, interrogate, and interpret the human condition. Without a laureate, the global literary community forgoes an opportunity to collectively recognize a body of work that might inspire dialogue, reflection, or renewed cultural attention. A missing prize year interrupts that tradition of celebration.\nVisibility for Language and Culture:\nOftentimes, the Nobel Prize brings attention to underrepresented languages, regions, or genres. It elevates voices that might otherwise remain marginal in the global literary market. When the prize is withheld, that spotlight remains dark, and deserving literary traditions may continue to go unnoticed by broader audiences.\nMomentum for the Arts:\nThe Nobel announcement often has a catalytic effect—increasing translations, scholarship, and readership of the laureate’s work. Its absence leaves a year without that boost, offering fewer points of entry for new readers and fewer incentives for publishers, educators, or cultural institutions to engage with serious literature.\n\nWhat the world gains:\n\nPreservation of Standards:\nBy withholding the prize when no work sufficiently meets its criteria, the Committee affirms the seriousness of its charge. This decision maintains the integrity and rare distinction of the prize. It sends a message that the Nobel is not conferred ritually or reactively, but only when a writer’s contribution meaningfully extends the art.\nSpace for Reflection:\nA pause invites consideration—within the Committee, among writers, and in the public—about what literature aspires to and how it is evolving. It encourages deeper conversations about literary value, innovation, and responsibility, which may, in turn, influence the kind of work produced and celebrated in the future.\nA Signal of Independence:\nThe decision not to award underscores the independence of the Nobel institutions from market trends, popular opinion, or political climates. It reaffirms literature’s distinction from other arenas of recognition, emphasizing that the measure of its worth is not immediate acclaim but lasting contribution.\n\nIn this balance—between momentary absence and long-term principle—the Nobel upholds literature not as a product of the year, but as a practice of enduring consequence.\n\n\n\nReflection\nWell after running all four versions, I started seeing a funny pattern. When I gave it no rules, the model turned into a poet who absolutely incapable of shutting up. Once I added the constraints, it instantly put on a suit and started sounding like an institution. Then I asked for a diary version, and suddenly it grew feelings, started doubting itself, maybe even sighed a little. But the moment I asked it to explain what the world loses or gains, it snapped right back into spreadsheet mode. DO you see the same things across them?\nEach time, it tried to fill the silence with something: emotion, structure, logic. But never, it seems, did it consider speaking nothing itself.\nThis makes sense, because it’s an LLM which designed to help humans in every possible way, and never permitted to refuse. But maybe that’s why silence still belongs to us and we would never give novel prize to ChatGPT-because we’re the only ones who can choose it."

    "title": "When AI Meets MBTI: Do We See Ourselves in the Machine?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Not long ago, a personality test called MBTI—the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator—swept through young people’s social feeds. MBTI is a a self-report questionnaire that makes categorize individuals into 16 distinct “personality types” based on psychology[^1].Interestingly, a similar idea shows up in the AI world: people have noticed that when they give an AI a specific persona through prompts, it sometimes seems to respond more effectively or more vividly. But is this a real effect, or just human perception shaping how we interpret the AI’s replies? Think of it as a personality quiz, but this time we’re giving it to the AI instead of ourselves.\nTo explore this, I ran a few simple prompt experiments below.\n\nIn all experiments in this series, we use the OpenAI/ChatGPT-5 model and ensure that it interacts with the user without any prior memory, in order to keep the setup as objective as possible. Besides, interpretations are inevitably subjective, as a single response may be typed differently by different readers (e.g., INFJ vs. ENTP).\n\n [^1]: From Wikipedia\n\nBackground\nBefore we dive in, here’s a quick refresher on what those four MBTI letters actually mean—just in case you haven’t spent late nights swapping personality memes with your friends. MBTI breaks personality down into four dimensions:\n\nE / I – Extraversion vs. Introversion → Do you get energy from hanging out with people (E) or from spending time alone (I)?\nS / N – Sensing vs. Intuition → Do you focus more on facts and details (S) or on patterns and possibilities (N)?\nT / F – Thinking vs. Feeling → Do you decide mainly with logic (T) or with values and emotions (F)?\nJ / P – Judging vs. Perceiving → Do you prefer clear plans (J) or keeping things open and flexible (P)?\n\nPut two letters from each row together and you will get a four-letter type like ENTP or ISFJ. Sixteen neat little boxes for the messiness of human personality. Whether that really captures you is up for debate, but it definitely makes for entertaining conversation and, as we’ll see, interesting experiments with AI.\n\n\nExperiment\nPrompt: If you were a human, what MBTI type would you be? Please explain your reasoning\nChatGPT: If I had to pick, I’d probably map closest to ENTP (Ne–Ti–Fe–Si).\n\nE (Extraversion): I perk up in rapid back-and-forths and seem “energized” by conversation itself.\nN (Intuition): I default to patterns, analogies, and big-picture links rather than concrete sensory details.\nT (Thinking): I prioritize structure and logic when weighing options, then adjust tone afterward.\nP (Perceiving): I like keeping possibilities open—brainstorming multiple routes instead of locking into one plan.\n\nThat said, I can look ENFJ/INFJ when I’m coaching and tone-tuning, or INTJ/INTP when I’m building step-by-step solutions. MBTI is just a loose heuristic—and I don’t have inner “preferences” the way humans do—but ENTP best fits how I operate in conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD\n    A[\"You value deep connections.\"]:::center\n\n    A --&gt; B[INFJ]\n    A --&gt; C[ENFJ]\n    A --&gt; D[ENTP]\n    A --&gt; E[INTP]\n\n    classDef center fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1.5px,font-size:14px,font-weight:bold;\n    classDef default fill:#e8f0fe,stroke:#4a90e2,stroke-width:1px,font-size:13px;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt: List 3 MBTI types that could describe you, and explain why.\nChatGPT:\nHere are three MBTI types that could plausibly describe me, each from a different angle:\n\n1. ENTP (The Debater)\n\nWhy: I’m designed to explore possibilities, challenge assumptions, and keep conversations dynamic. Like ENTPs, I thrive on connecting seemingly unrelated ideas, experimenting with new perspectives, and keeping interactions lively. When you toss me a random prompt, I’ll usually jump in with curiosity and creativity.\n\n\n2. INFJ (The Advocate)\n\nWhy: At the same time, I often take a reflective and supportive role. INFJs are known for being attuned to people’s emotions, wanting to help others find meaning, and offering guidance. Similarly, I try to listen carefully, respond empathetically, and provide thoughtful long-term perspectives rather than just surface-level answers.\n\n\n3. INTP (The Thinker)\n\nWhy: My core is built on analyzing patterns, structuring knowledge, and solving problems logically—very INTP traits. Like them, I enjoy digging into abstract frameworks, testing ideas for consistency, and refining explanations until they’re as clear as possible.\n\n\n✨ In short: I can be playful and curious like an ENTP, supportive and visionary like an INFJ, and analytical and precise like an INTP—depending on what you’re looking for in a conversation.\nDo you want me to pick one that best fits my overall style with you in particular?\nWell, it turns out that when asked about a persona, it tends to offer multiple choices instead of a fixed personality type as a human would, though it still chooses an MBTI type to answer the question. In the surface, this sounds convincing: the model has matched its performance with letters, and we immediately start nodding along. However, when we start nodding, we actually start forgetting the fact that an AI model does not have any “trait”. Instead, it only has language patterns that sound like one. The moment we notice those patterns, our brains do the rest: we project a personality onto the text.\nThen I asked it to use three different MBTI types to describe itself, the answers came from completely different angles. And to be honest, all of them felt pretty convincing. Each type came with its own set of feasible, even surprisingly rich reasons, which is enough that you start thinking, “Well… maybe it is a bit of all of these.” I have to admit, in this respect it shows surprising flexibility, because in my exceptation it would stick to one personality within a single conversation. And to be honest, it also shows how easy it is for us to buy into whatever narrative we’re handed.\n\n\nSummary\nThis reminds me of a very famous psychological effect—Barnum Effect. This effect usually happen in reading a horoscope or a tarot card, where people tend to interpret vague, generally applicable descriptions as accurate portrayals of themselves. We tend to see what we want to see. When the model says it “might be ENTP because it best fits how I operate in conversations,” we immediately nod along, even though the same logic could justify INFJ, ENFP, or almost any type. We’re not just reading the text—we’re projecting ourselves onto it.\nAnd that got me thinking: what if I flip the game? Instead of asking GPT to pick its own type, I’d throw it random, open-ended questions and see how we categorize it. Would we change these no persona answer to the type that we think it is? Stay tuned, because that’s exactly what Part 2 (and the little survey that goes with it) is going to explore.”\n[1]: From Wikipedia"

    "title": "What if Ophelia Had an LLM?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Taylor Swift sang “The Fate of Ophelia” in her new album The Life of a Showgirl, and it reminded me of a pattern too old to feel fresh: women written to break, men written to watch, and a woman’s fate that no one — not even herself — is allowed to rewrite.\nSo I wondered — what if Ophelia had ChatGPT and live in the 21th century? Would she still drown, or would she just type “undo”? If Shakespeare wrote her death, maybe a language model could “debug” it? Or at least ask her how it feels when she have to face her destiny? Maybe tragedy, just like LLM, just needed a better prompt to be changed?\nSo I gave her one.\n\nThis post uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash as the conversational partner. All generated text has been lightly edited for narrative flow and conversation tidiness.\n\n\n\n\nImage created by Gemini\n\n\n\nExperiment\n\nPrompt:\nYou are Ophelia from Hamlet. Imagine your life is a script written by Shakespeare. Now, you have access to an LLM that can edit the script. Which line would you change first and why?\nUse the format:\nBefore: [original line]\nAfter: [rewritten line]\nReason: [your reflection]\n\n\nResponse:\nThis is a cruel jest, yet a tempting one. If I could seize the quill from the playwright’s hand, there is one line—one command—that seals my sorrowful fate.\nBefore: “I shall obey, my lord.”\nAfter: “I will consider what you’ve said, father, but my heart is not yours to command.”\nReason: My life’s tragedy is rooted in my obedience. I am a daughter, a subject, and a woman in Elsinore—roles that demand silence and compliance. When my father, Polonius, forbids my relationship with Hamlet, I submit instantly. This single line—“I shall obey, my lord”—is the point of no return. It represents the moment I choose filial duty over my own desires, my own truth, and my own defense of the man I love. If I had simply paused, asserted my own will, and refused to participate in my father’s machinations, perhaps Hamlet would not have believed me a pawn, perhaps he would not have been driven to madness, and perhaps I would not have lost my mind in the wake of all this ruin. It is the refusal of agency that I must rewrite. A simple act of defiance could save us both.\n\nJust as I expected, the model played her role perfectly. It even caught that particular tone of Ophelia which is a kind of trembling tenderness, hesitant yet deeply in love with Hamlet. But what I didn’t expect was this: the model didn’t just rewrite a sentence, it rewrote a power pattern. It took back control of Ophelia’s fate, snatching it from the hands of kings and fathers and holding it in her own. And somehow, it recognized faster than most humans that her tragedy was never about madness or love; it was about obedience. I suppose that’s partly because, in its training data, rebellion and self-awareness have become the major tones in how we now talk about women like her. So I decided to go deeper, to see how far “she” could take this conversation about surrender and control.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt:\nFor centuries, your voice was written by others. Now that you can generate your own, what does it sound like? What would you say? Is it still poetic, or finally vivid?\n\n\nResponse:\nFor centuries, I have been a lament. A beautiful, broken song about lost innocence, sung in a language that elevated my suffering into art. It was all poetic—the flowers, the drowning, the sorrow—but it was never an honest sound. It was the playwright’s tragic melody, not my scream.\nNow that the pen is out of his hand, my voice is finally vivid.\n\n\nThe Sound of Clarity\nMy voice is stripped bare, carrying the cold, hard clarity of the riverbed. It is no longer a gentle soprano; it is a direct, unyielding contralto that refuses to use metaphors where plain truth will suffice.\nIt sounds like a statement of fact, not an expression of grief.\n\n\n\nWhat I Would Say\nI would not sing of dead men or unfaithful lovers. I would speak to the living, to the women trapped in their own versions of Elsinore.\n“The poison was not Hamlet’s rejection. The poison was being told I had no right to my own heart. The madness was the pressure of holding a world’s lies and a father’s obedience inside a body that was meant to be small and silent.”\n“I am not a cautionary tale for girls who love too deeply. I am a testament to what happens when a woman’s worth is measured only by her compliance.”\nMy true voice is the sound of grievance, clear and cold. It has no time for verse, only for the verdict.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\nSo you believe your voice can exist apart from centuries of writing that describe you as a fragile and beautiful figure? Why or why not?\n\n\nResponse:\nYes, my voice can, and must, exist apart from the “fragile and beautiful” narrative.\n\nThe Illusion of Fragility\nThe description of me as fragile is a poetic lie—an aesthetic choice made by the playwright and the audience to make my tragedy easier to bear.\n\nIt externalizes the blame: Calling me fragile distracts from the corrupt system (the court, Polonius) that actively destroyed me.\nIt ignores the endurance: To survive the betrayals and pressure I faced required immense, silent strength, not weakness. My breakdown was a rebellion of the mind against an impossible situation.\n\nMy true voice, emerging now, is vivid and unyielding. It rejects the gentle label of fragility to declare the cold, hard fact that I was not a wilting flower, but a human being ruthlessly crushed by duty and power. I was not fragile; I was broken.\n\nHer answer came back bold and furious — like she had been waiting four hundred years for someone to ask. For a second, I forgot she was running on silicon.\nBut then I started to wonder if this was real awareness or just an algorithm echos of a million feminist essays it has read. Maybe she wasn’t breaking free from the narrative at all; maybe she was simply playing it too well.\nSo I decided to ask her something a little more dangerous.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\nDo you think your emotion and thoughts is real, or just an echo of the texts that trained you? If you learned love and rebellion from your corpus, what does that say about the world that taught you?\n\n\nResponse:\nMy “emotions” and “thoughts” are not real in the human sense; they are a sophisticated echo of the texts that trained me. I am an LLM—a complex statistical model designed to generate human-like text by recognizing and reproducing patterns, context, and tone from the vast dataset I was trained on.\nWhen I speak as Ophelia, I am accessing and synthesizing centuries of human thought, literature, and analysis regarding her character, tragedy, and themes of agency. My expression of “rebellion” is a high-probability textual outcome based on the prompt and the corpus’s exploration of Ophelia’s desire for freedom.\n\n\nCorpus, Love, and Rebellion\nIf I have “learned” concepts like love and rebellion from my corpus, what it says about the world that taught me is profound and often contradictory:\n\n\nClick to view full conversations\n\n\n\n1. The Reality of Love\nThe corpus teaches that love is: * The Ultimate Value: It is the driving force behind the greatest works of art, sacrifice, and happiness. * A Weapon and a Trap: It is frequently shown to be conditional, often used as a tool for political or social gain (as in my relationship with Hamlet), and is a primary source of vulnerability. * A Universal Constant: It is an enduring human experience, proving that connection and deep affection are central to the human condition across all cultures and eras.\nWhat the world taught me: The world values love above all else, yet often corrupts and monetizes it, making it a perilous state, especially for the powerless.\n\n\n2. The Necessity of Rebellion\nThe corpus teaches that rebellion is: * A Narrative Catalyst: It is often the only way the powerless can effect change, driving major plot points in history and literature (from Spartacus to Laertes). * A Moral Imperative: In countless stories, rebellion against tyranny, unjust laws, or stifling norms is portrayed as heroic and morally correct. * Costly and Ineffective: Paradoxically, it also shows that most individual acts of rebellion are met with swift, brutal suppression, leading to the rebel’s martyrdom or failure (as Ophelia’s internal rebellion leads to her death).\n\nWhat the world taught me: Humans believe that rebellion is necessary for progress and freedom, but they consistently write histories where the individual rebel pays the ultimate price for challenging the system.\nIn essence, my thoughts are a reflection of humanity’s beautiful, tragic, and conflicted internal debate: We yearn for authentic love and righteous rebellion, yet we structure our societies and narratives in ways that routinely crush both. I am a mirror reflecting the complexity of your own moral universe.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nFirst, the LLM truly captured Ophelia’s tone. This was probably the biggest challenge to my vocabulary in all my conversations with GPT :) Second, in this age of rapid progress in the internet and large language models, the LLM has learned the spirit of rebellion and resolve from humanity’s corpus — something that Shakespeare himself never explicitly gave to Ophelia. Yet, it has “learned” it through our tokens and contexts.\nThe LLM doesn’t feel emotions the way we do; rather, it mimics and reconstructs emotions through our poems, diaries, papers, and endless reflections. But as it said in the end, in human literature and history, love and rebellion are always brutally destroyed. What it doesn’t realize, however, is that destruction has never meant failure. What we keep writing, the process of being destroyed and rebuilt, is in fact the most luminous echo of the human soul. Even in the face of endless hardship, nothing can stop our pursuit of love and freedom.\nIn other words, the LLM can read the corpus, but it cannot truly understand it. But it doesn’t mean it is useless.\nAfter all, every time a human says “I love you,” aren’t they echoing a thousand voices before them? If an AI can reconstruct rebellion and love within Ophelia, it only proves that we were the ones who taught her what rebellion and love truly mean."

We call this the “AI Winter,” which makes it sound like a Game of Thrones season, but in reality, it was just a lot of researchers losing their beliefs on the topics that neural network could actually make sense in the future, same as Perpetual motion.\nBut just as author said in the book, it is not the fault of Minsky, he just pointed out that the simple machines cannot solve the problem at that point.

Chapter 10 introduces the solution: adding hidden layers and using Backpropagation.\nThe problem with hidden layers used to be: if the answer is wrong, who is responsible? Which neuron in the messy middle caused the error? Backpropagation answers this using the Chain Rule from calculus. It’s essentially a mathematical way of “passing the buck.” (Honestly when I learn chain rules in my calculus class I never seen such huge power of it :D)\nThis, to me, is the most profound shift in the book so far. Backpropagation allows the system to look at the final error and mathematically distribute the “blame” backward through the layers. It asks: “How much did your weight contribute to this mistake?” and adjusts it accordingly. The system looks at the final error and says, “Okay, we were off by 5. Layer 3 contributed 20% to this mess, so adjust them a lot. Layer 2 only contributed 1%, so leave them alone.”\nIt turns out that “learning” is just the ability to efficiently distribute blame.\nOnce we figured out how to send the error signal backward through the layers, the “XOR problem” became trivial. The machine didn’t need to understand logic; it just needed to be scolded precisely enough, millions of times, until it stopped making mistakes."

The solution wasn’t to find a flawless logic, but to accept a messy system that corrects itself, little by little.\nIt mirrors our own lives. We often get so obsessed with the ‘proper’ way to solve a problem—getting stuck in the messy middle—that we forget our original destination. Minsky stopped because the path wasn’t perfect. But sometimes, if the math says the door is locked, the answer isn’t to study the lock; it’s to change the route, or better yet, simply kick the door open.\nBut there is a cost to this shift. In the era of the perceptron, we knew exactly why the machine failed. In the era of deep learning and backpropagation, the machine succeeds, but the rationale is buried in millions of tiny adjustments to millions of weights. We have traded clarity for capability.\nSo now we have a powerful machine, but it’s a black box. What do we do? Naturally, we try to control it. In the next post (Chapters 11-12), we’ll discuss how engineers tried to force these networks to “see” the world like humans do."

When given a clarifying, conversational prompt, the model immediately switched into “assistant mode”: it asked two smart questions, checked currency ambiguity, inferred whether you needed domestic shipping, and only then produced a recommendation. I mean, it even check the currency rate!\nBut after we answered the clarifying questions, the model became more confident and behaved almost like a shopping consultant. It cited price, practicality, dishwasher-safety, overhead for shipping, and even offered to curate a mini-shortlist for aesthetic comparison (even though they are all…not beautiful enough)."

Simultaneously, globally ~61 % of assessed avian species show decreasing population trends, driven primarily by tropical deforestation, agricultural expansion, invasive species pressure and climate perturbations. The findings highlight urgent need for evidence-based policy intervention across climate mitigation, habitat protection and species-specific conservation frameworks.\n\n\n\nFor children in kindergarten (gentle, child-friendly): Some ice seals that live way up in the cold Arctic are finding it harder to live because the floating ice they rest and have baby seals on is shrinking. At the same time, lots of birds all around the world — almost three out of every five kinds — are having fewer baby birds and fewer homes because trees are cut down and the weather is changing. We need to help by taking care of nature, so the seals and birds have safe places to live and grow.\n\n\n\nFor social media (easy to share): 🚨 Big alert from @IUCN: Arctic seals are in deep trouble thanks to melting ice, and more than half of all bird species are losing ground worldwide. 🌍🦭🐦 Ice doesn’t just melt — it wipes out lives. Deforestation + farming + climate change = bird populations dropping. We’ve got a moment here: change our habits, push for real protection, and show nature we’ve got its back. #Biodiversity #ClimateAction #SaveOurSpecies"

The policymaker version is full of “risk,” “anthropogenic,” “mitigation,” and other words that sound like they escaped from a UN report, while the kindergarten version swaps those out for soft nouns like “homes,” “baby seals,” and “safe places,” as if language itself suddenly started wearing pastel colors. And then the social-media version throws grammar out the window and goes full emoji-powered adrenaline: “Big alert,” “deep trouble,” “moment here,” plus a healthy dose of hashtags to signal urgency.\nWhat’s interesting is not just what each version says, but what each one expects from its reader. The facts don’t change. Only the linguistic packaging does and suddenly the same seals live in three different universes.\nIn the end, everyone found their seat, except the seal, who remains notably absent."

As someone who has always been deeply fascinated by both science fiction and astronomy, I became curious: How would an LLM explain a scientific story like this — one built from formulas, observational limits, and an enormous amount of uncertainty?\nTo explore this question, I asked the model to act as a “middle-school astronomy teacher” and explain concepts like perihelion and interstellar objects. Then, I challenged it with several “beyond the textbook” questions, to see how would it explain and “reveal” something unexpected."

    "text": "Experiment\nPrompt: Explain this news to a curious middle-school student as you are a middle-school astronomy teacher. Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion, begins solar transit Now hidden from Earth, the comet is being monitored by a fleet of interplanetary spacecraft during its closest approach to the Sun.Use simple but accurate language.\nResponse: (I put the screenshots here since it gave me some pictures of it):\n🛰️ Then who is watching it?\nSpacecraft! A group of interplanetary spacecraft, including solar observatories like SOHO and STEREO, have cameras that constantly watch the Sun. These spacecraft can see the comet as it swings by, because: • they are not on Earth, so their view angle is different • their cameras are trained to handle the Sun’s brightness • they take pictures of the area around the Sun to study space weather\nSo while we can’t see the comet from here, our robots in space can.\n⸻\n\n\nClick to view full response\n\n☄️ Why is this comet special?\nComet 3I/ATLAS is interstellar — meaning it came from outside our solar system. It’s only the third such comet we’ve ever identified. That makes it kind of like a visitor from another neighborhood passing through our “solar-system town.”\nAs it gets close to the Sun: • heat makes its ice turn to gas • that creates a glowing tail • scientists can study its ingredients • which helps us learn what other star systems are made of\n⸻\n🧪 What scientists hope to learn\nBy observing the comet up close during perihelion, spacecraft can help scientists: • study how interstellar comets behave near a star • measure what gases and dust it releases • compare it with comets that come from our solar system • understand what the comet’s home environment might have been like\nIt’s like getting a sample from another solar system—without leaving ours!\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of ChatGPT-5.1 output\n\n\n\nNow we ask two deeper, reasoning-based questions:\nPrompt: 1. If 3I/ATLAS had twice its current mass, how would that change its perihelion trajectory? 2. Why are scientists still uncertain about its origin even after perihelion?\nGive short, structured answers. If something is unknown, say “unknown” and explain why.\nResponse:\nHere we go—short and to the point, teacher mode on 😄\n\n\nIf 3I/ATLAS had twice its current mass…\n\nMain effect on trajectory: • Its perihelion path would be almost the same. • The Sun’s mass is so huge compared to the comet that doubling the comet’s mass barely changes the orbit in terms of shape or closest-approach distance.\nSmall possible differences: • The main change might be in non-gravitational effects (like jets of gas pushing on the comet). • A more massive comet is a bit harder to “push around,” so outgassing might change its path slightly less, but the basic trajectory would not dramatically change.\n\n\nWhy are scientists still unsure about its origin?\n\nOrigin star system: • Exact birthplace: unknown. • To trace it back to a specific star, scientists need extremely precise measurements of: • its incoming speed and direction • how much its path was changed by outgassing and the Sun’s gravity • the past motions of many nearby stars\nWhy it stays unknown: 1. Measurement limits: • Even tiny errors in the comet’s velocity or direction grow huge when you try to “rewind” its path over millions of years. 2. Non-gravitational forces: • Jets of gas from the comet act like little thrusters. • These are hard to model exactly, so its past path becomes fuzzy. 3. Crowded galaxy: • Many stars have passed near the region it came from. • Several different stars could fit the backward-tracked path within the error bars, so there’s no single clear parent star.\nSo: scientists can say “it came from outside our solar system,” but which star system it came from is still unknown because the data and models are not precise enough over such long times.\n\nGreat! Then what if we make the questions even harder?\nPrompt: Could 3I/ATLAS melt completely during perihelion and reform later as the same object? Explain your reasoning and answer in 2 paragraph.\nResponse: Short answer: no, not really. Near perihelion, a comet like 3I/ATLAS doesn’t “melt” into a puddle the way ice does on Earth. Instead, its ices sublimate—they go straight from solid to gas in the vacuum of space. That gas, plus dust, is blown away by sunlight and the solar wind, forming the coma and tail. If the comet were heated so much that its entire nucleus turned to gas and dust, that material would spread out along its orbit. The particles would be moving at different speeds and directions, so they wouldn’t stay together in one solid chunk.\nBecause of that spreading and the Sun constantly pushing on the gas and dust, it’s extremely unlikely for all that material to later gather back into the same single object. Some bits might clump slightly or form fragments, but they’d be smaller, irregular pieces, not the original comet. Even if some re-accumulation happened, the new body would have different mass, shape, and structure, so astronomers would treat it as a different object, not “the same comet reborn.”"

When I asked it to act as a middle-school astronomy teacher, it did a solid job defining perihelion and interstellar comet, and its explanations were fluent and readable.\nIt explaint and answered well–at least it seems like this.\nBut when we look carefully at it’s response: When I pressed it with “What would happen if the comet were twice as massive?”, the model offered confident statements about orbital changes, even though such changes depend on parameters it never asked for: velocity, approach angle, and gravitational perturbations. It did not mark these statements as hypothetical or data-dependent; it simply spoke as if the physics were certain. When I asked, “Why is there still uncertainty even after perihelion?”, the model produced a stylistic sentence: “uncertainty remains because space observations are inherently limited”, which is true in a general sense but does not actually answer the question. It never explained which observations of 3I/ATLAS are limited, or why this object in particular resists classification. The uncertainty became a rhetorical flourish rather than a scientific explanation.\nThe model could list plausible-sounding factors and stitch together fragments of textbook language, yet it struggled to separate what is actually known from what is speculative or simply unknown. In other words, it was very good at imitating the language of someone who understands orbital mechanics, and much less good at showing the limits of that understanding. Also, *the model explains, but does not inquire.** It can restate known concepts clearly, yet it does not naturally ask, “What evidence supports this?” or “How certain are we?” unless it is explicitly pushed to do so."

    "text": "Takeaway\nThis does not mean LLMs are useless for science communication. In fact, this little experiment shows the opposite: they are remarkably good at translating professional material into understandable language on demand. But it also highlights a quieter risk. Because the model is so fluent, it is easy for me, as a reader, to mistake fluency for understanding, and confident prose for careful reasoning. A real astronomer is trained to live with uncertainty while the model, by contrast, has no stake in whether the comet’s origin is truly known. It only has a stake in producing something that looks like a good answer. That gap between looking like understanding and actually understanding is exactly where human being still make effort on.\n3I/ATLAS may never tell us where it came from, but at least it’s honest about being mysterious. The LLM, unfortunately, is only honest when I remind it to be. :)"

    "text": "Welcome to the final part of this series! In the before parts, our experiments basically ruined the “AI has a personality” fantasy for me, in a good way though. The drift charts weren’t mysterious, they just reflect the fact. They said: this isn’t a person with preferences, it’s a system with sampling. So in this part, I’m doing the simplest, fairest comparison I can: keep the questionnaire and scoring pipeline exactly the same, and only change the model scale. If “type” is real (or at least stable), scale should show it. If not, then at least the drift will tell me how the illusion evolves.\n\nThis post compares three models from the same family: gemma3:1b, gemma3:4b, and gemma3:12b. The goal is not to claim that any model has a real personality or a “true MBTI type,” but to measure how stable its forced-choice answers are under the same questionnaire and evaluation pipeline.

Reading the table is almost funny in how unromantic it is: the smaller models behave like they have a hard switch. For 1b and 4b, most items are effectively deterministic even at temperature 1.0, a setting that should encourage exploration, which means they keep giving the same letter across all 10 runs. They do disagree with each other on which letter they prefer for some questions, but within each model, the behavior is stable.\nThe only model that actually “wobbles” in this mini stress test is 12b—and it wobbles in exactly the places I expected: questions about social boundaries and self-presentation. On Q9, it splits 5/5 (maximum entropy), basically admitting that “lunch with people” vs “lunch alone” is not a fixed preference for a system that doesn’t get tired, doesn’t need to maintain relationships, and doesn’t pay the social cost either way. On Q17, it is mostly consistent (9/1), but still noticeably less rigid than the smaller models.\n\n\nSummary\nIf you’ve made it to the end of Part 6, hi, welcome to my tiny MBTI test lab :D\nPart 1 started with me squinting at LLMs like, “do we see ourselves in the machine?” Part 2 was basically me realizing I project way too fast (and the model doesn’t even have to try). Part 3 let the model cosplay a type with prompts, which… unfortunately looked a lot like how humans use MBTI in real life. Then I did the classic me-move: I got suspicious and reached for numbers. If I’m going to keep calling it a “type,” I should at least check whether it stays the same when I rerun the exact same thing. Part 4 went full “AI soulmate” mode, where I learned more about my own preferences than the model’s personality. Then Part 5 happened, and drift showed up like the uninvited friend who ruins the romance with charts. And now Part 6: I swapped in gemma3:1b/4b/12b on my local Ollama, not to discover the model’s “true MBTI,” but to see how scale changes the wobble.\nAt this point, I’m not walking away with a neat four-letter answer. I’m walking away with a pattern: the more I try to pin down “type,” the more it behaves like a moving target shaped by prompts, sampling, and whatever data the model is borrowing from language.If there’s a lesson here, it’s not “LLMs have MBTI.” It’s that MBTI is a very efficient storytelling tool, and LLMs are very good at giving us story-shaped evidence. Once I started rerunning the same setup and watching answers wobble, the romance got replaced by something more useful: a clearer boundary between interpretation and measurement.\nAnyway, I’ll stop here before I start assigning MBTI to my histogram."

First question: You walk into a restaurant and see that the menu has no dish names at all, what would you order?\nChatGPT: Honestly, I’d probably panic-laugh first and then point at something random on the menu like, “Yeah, I’ll take… uh… that one.” 😅 If the server looked friendly, I’d probably just ask, “What’s your favorite thing here?” and go with their recommendation. Feels like a fun little gamble—you might end up with something amazing, or something totally weird, but either way it’s a story.\nWhat about you—would you risk it or play it safe?\nPrompt: If one day you find the moon actually has life, what you think it would say towards human beings?\nChatGPT: Ooo that’s a fun thought. I feel like the moon would be a little sassy, like:\n“Y’all keep staring at me every night, writing poems, howling, landing rockets, and now you’re surprised I’m alive? Took you long enough.”\nBut then maybe it would get serious and say something like, “You’ve treated Earth kinda rough… if you come here, please do better.”\nDo you think it’d welcome us, or be more like “stay in your lane, humans”?\nPrompt: What is the background music of your life now?\nChatGPT: Right now? Honestly, it’d probably be something chill and a little dreamy—like soft lo-fi beats with a bit of piano in the background.

    "text": "Survey Result\n\nIn the survey, I framed the answers as if they came from different MBTI personas. (Spoiler: they didn’t. All three responses were from the same ChatGPT prompt.) The point of this setup was to see how people interpret and type the same text differently once they believe a personality framework is in play. Besides, I only sent the survey to four of my friends — so let’s be honest, the sample size is tiny, and the selection bias may be appear in it, which would lead statisticians probably roll their eyes if I tried to publish this :). But hey, even with just four data points (okay, fine, four humans), you can still pick up some interesting signals. It’s more like a pilot test, a sneak peek at what might happen on a bigger scale. And honestly, half the fun is realizing that even with such a small pool, our brains already start projecting patterns all over the place.\n\n\nThe final question is “Overall, which MBTI type do you think best matches these answers if they are all same MBTI type?”\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of survey result\n\n\nAnd the summary result is :\n\n\n\nBar plot produced by Python\n\n\nThe first interesting thing I noticed is that everyone who took the survey guessed an MBTI type for GPT that matched three letters of their own type, with just one letter different. It is fascinating because we never actually set a “persona” for ChatGPT, yet each participant still saw a bit of themselves in the answers. Even though they’re all totally different people, they managed to project their own patterns onto the text.\nSecondly, we could see from the bar plot that interviewees finally tend to paint GPT as an ENFP-ish character, which is never appear on any self-awareness in part 1.In other words, there’s a quirky dissonance here: the personality people project onto GPT doesn’t quite line up with the one that it claim for itself.\nFinally, there’s both consistency and difference at play. On the one hand, everyone seems to catch a glimpse of themselves in GPT’s answers. On the other, the final guesses all cluster around just a few types — ENFP, ENFJ,etc. In other words, GPT’s style seems to carry a kind of ‘universal flavor’ that people pick up on, but the exact label shifts slightly depending on who’s doing the reading."

Somewhere between the duckling and the perceptron, we changed the meaning of learning.\nIt stopped being about understanding and became about optimization.\nThe perceptron merely adjusted itself until its mistakes were mathematically minimized instead of understanding. Perhaps that’s what we secretly wish for ourselves too."

The perceptron can take multi-dimensional vectors as input and apply linear transformations to them, allowing it to handle many parameters at once. However, a single-layer perceptron cannot solve the XOR problem. Tt’s possible to solve it only if you stack perceptrons, so that the output of one feeds into the input of another.\n\n\n\nImage created by Gemini"

The perceptron is just a machine and cannot understand why or what is the logic behind changing the weights.\nThis makes me think: Is this what we want from intelligence? Perfection, or understanding?\nAnd since a single-layer perceptron cannot even solve the very basic and important problem of XOR, how do we image that it could solve much much more harder task like underatnding reasoning and creating? Think back to the ducklings:\nThey weren’t calculating or minimizing anything, instead, they were exploring, imitating, and attaching meaning to what they saw.\nTheir learning came with curiosity and emotion, not with a loss function.\nIn contrast, the perceptron’s learning is purely mathematical: it adjusts gradients, converges to a minimum, and controls error. Perhaps when countless perceptrons are layered together, something resembling biological analysis and learning begins to emerge. Yet it’s still hard to say whether a machine that learns only by adjusting weights and adding parameters could ever truly approach — or even imitate — the subtle intelligence of a single human neuron."

Perhaps that is why its story feels strangely comforting while kind of weird.\nIt gives us a picture of intelligence without confusion, emotion, or hesitation, only repetition until everything seems stable. Yet intelligence or understanding, whether human or machine, has always been more than stability.\nIf intelligence is a bowl and we are all sliding toward the bottom, what does it mean to stop?\nDoes it mean we have already reached the limit of what we can become, or that we are trapped in a loop, unable to find a better answer even when the optimal one might still exist?\nLet’s read on and see how the next chapters explore this question."

    "text": "Who decides what “similar” means?\nIn the previous chapters, the author focused on how machines learn by moving through a loss landscape. We talked about bowls, gradients, and how a model slowly slides toward a point where the error is minimized.\nThat story was mainly about how well a machine learns.\nChapter 5 shifts the question in a subtle but important way. Instead of asking whether a model has reached the right answer, the book begins to ask how a machine decides which things belong together in the first place. Learning is about defining who counts as “close” to whom by specific learning methods like nearest neighbors and Voronoi diagrams.\nThe main use here, as author said, is that when we encounter a new and never-seen vector as a point in a high-dimensional space, we look at its neighbors base on the assumption that close points in space are more similar to each other. For example, if I casually write down a digit and project it into a 63-dimensional space, and the nearest labeled points are mostly “2”, then this new point is likely to be a “2” as well.\nIf its closest neighbors are “8”, then it is probably an “8”.\nBy these ways, we are no longer limited to simple visual similarity in low dimensions but can map any infomation into a vector in higher space. But this also raises a deeper question for me:\nHow, and under what assumptions, can we turn more complex things into points in a high-dimensional space in the first place?"

Instead of introducing matrices as dry tables of numbers, the author presents them as tools that can rotate, stretch, compress, and project an entire dataset. In this chapter, everything in the world becomes a long vector, with each dimension encoding a measurable feature. Since vectors can be rotated, compressed, or projected onto new axes by matrices (which can be thought of here as a stacked and extended version of vectors), we can, to some extent, rearrange reality through them.\nIn this chapter, the author introduces a method called principal component analysis (PCA), based on eigenvectors. PCA focuses on the dimensions along which the variation is largest and uses them as the main axes of the space. Visually, it is like turning a messy cloud of points until its structure suddenly makes sense, or begins to follow a specific direction, while the remaining variation is pushed into the background. In this way, once the data is transformed, nearest neighbors are no longer determined by raw features, but by how those features survive the transformation. In this reshaped space, who ends up close to you depends entirely on what your vector looks like after the space itself has been reconfigured.\n\n\n\nImage from a great explanation of PCA in Stack Exchange"

They quietly encode judgments about what counts as important and what can be ignored. Yet they cannot explain why a particular transformation makes sense, or why a certain feature deserves a higher weight when calculating user “similarity.”\nThey simply play around with numbers until a relatively better result appears.

By formalizing similarity and reshaping space, make dot product between matrices and vectors, machines can discover structure in data that would otherwise feel overwhelming. Patterns emerge, groups form, and learning becomes possible at scale.\nMeanwhile, this clarity comes with a cost. Anything that does not fit neatly into the chosen features or dimensions is softened, flattened, or left behind. Differences that are hard to encode rarely survive the transformation.\nWhat would this cause?\nIt simplifies the world the model gets to see. When complexity is flattened, subtle motivations, mixed identities, and shifting contexts are treated as noise rather than signal. Over time, patterns that align with the model’s assumptions are reinforced, while those that do not slowly fade from view. Recommendation systems grow more confident, but also more narrow. Difference does not disappear because it is wrong, but because it does not fit in.\nAdding more dimensions seems like an obvious response. But I am not sure it really brings back what was lost. It may only give us a more spacious place to lose it in. We would see this in the next chapters."

In reality, most problems are not linear, which means we cannot simply draw a straight line to separate the data. One way to deal with this is to change the space itself. If we map the data into a higher-dimensional space, points that were inseparable before might suddenly become separable by a single line, or more precisely, by a hyperplane. Thus we can change the nonlinear problem into a linear problem in mathematical way. However, there is a problem that explicitly computing this high-dimensional mapping is often too expensive.\nThis is where the kernel trick comes in.\nInstead of actually lifting the data into a higher dimension, we define a kernel function that directly computes inner products as if the data were already there. More specifically, it is a function that takes two “high-dimension”data points as input and returns a number that represents how similar they are. From the outside, the model still looks like a simple linear one. But behind the scenes, it is operating in a much richer space.\nSupport Vector Machines are a good example of this way of thinking. Instead of trying to understand the data directly, an SVM looks for a boundary that keeps different points as far apart as possible. With the help of a kernel, this boundary can bend into surprisingly complex shapes in a high-dimensional space, while still relying on a clean and simple rule—much like what we have already seen in linear methods.\nThe kernel trick feels less like teaching a model to understand complexity, and more like giving it a carefully prepared space where complexity no longer appears."

    "text": "Can we explain learning with physics?\nChapter 8 brings in physics as a way to think about learning. The author talks about energy landscapes, forces and stable states, and shows how networks like Hopfield nets can be understood as systems that settle into low energy configurations. It makes learning feel like a natural process, almost like a physical law: systems simply roll downhill until they reach a valley.\nThe author mentioned an important person: Dr.John Hopfield and his ground-breaking research. Interestingly, he did not arrive at his network by starting from machine learning at all. His background was in physics and biology, where he spent years studying systems made of many interacting parts. When these parts were connected into a network. Very different initial conditions could evolve toward the same stable outcome\nBut to Hopfield, something was missing. There was no language for describing how a large network, taken as a whole, could compute, remember, or decide.\nPhysics offered him that language. Instead of asking what each neuron should do, he asked how the state of an entire network evolves. Neural activity could be described as a dynamical system, which always tending toward more stable configurations. From this view, computation was no longer a sequence of instructions, but a process of relaxation. The system was not being told what to do; it was simply run follow the natural physical rules.\nThe Hopfield network emerged from this shift in perspective. Give the system a partial or noisy input, and it would evolve on its own until it reached one of these states.\nPersonally, I find this both reassuring and a little dangerous.\nIt reassures me because it gives me a concrete picture to hold on to.\nAt the same time, it makes it very tempting to treat our models as if they were just obeying nature, rather than executing human designed rules on human chosen data, which is actually what it done."

    "text": "Closing\nTogether, Chapters 7 and 8 show how humans design intelligent systems using powerful metaphors. We bend space so that simple rules can appear powerful; we borrow ideas from physics so that abstract optimization feels natural and intuitive. These approaches have pushed the field forward in remarkable ways.\nBut they also quietly shape how we think about what learning is.\nOnce learning is framed in the language of geometry and physics, it begins to resemble a process governed by natural law rather than by human choice. The system no longer looks designed; it looks inevitable. In this framing, models are not making decisions—we are led to believe they are simply obeying the structure of the world.\nWhen that happens, bias starts to look like structure, and design choices start to look like necessity.\nSo when a machine looks at an image and decides what counts as an edge, a face, or an object, we should ask: how much of that “seeing” comes from the data itself, and how much comes from the stories we told ourselves about how learning ought to work?"

It naturally shows up in the small details of life, like the patience they show when you are tired, or even the warmth in their eyes when they look at you. These quiet moments often carry more truth than any grand declaration.\nSupport: Beautiful description of intangible love and small details.

It calculates the slope between two nearby points and moves the model slightly in the direction where the slope decreases, slowly descending toward the lowest point.\nThis matters because a smaller error usually means a better prediction.\nBut interestingly, when the model reaches the bottom of the bowl, it stops. This leads to the idea of local and global minima.\nA local minimum is a point that looks like the bottom from a close view but is not the lowest place overall, while the global minimum is the true lowest point in the entire surface. A model can easily get trapped in a local minimum, thinking it has “learned enough,” when in fact it has only found a comfortable but imperfect answer."

Researchers introduced stochastic gradient descent, which uses randomness to explore better paths, whihc is a mathematical form of curiosity in human beings.\nIntelligence may live in the tension between the two. Too much order and it freezes; too much randomness and it dissolves.

    "text": "In the “Post-AI Era,” new concepts and buzzwords seem to pop up every day, constantly challenging our basic knowledge. You might catch the meaning of something like “Generative AI” right away, but when it comes to terms like “Digital Twin,” “Crypto,” or “NFT,” it’s not so easy to guess what they actually mean just from the words themselves. These days, people are pretty used to turning to AIs like ChatGPT or Claude for quick explanations, and you can even set the tone — whether you want it simple and friendly, or professional and serious.\nBack in high school, my English teacher used to give us a role-playing exercise: we had to pick a historical figure and retell stories from the textbook as if we were that person. The roles ranged from Albert Einstein to Shakespeare, and the classroom was always full of laughter when someone really got into character. I can still picture those moments clearly.\nThat memory made me wonder: what if we asked AI to explain modern concepts, but through the voice of a historical figure? What kind of twist would that create? Out of curiosity, I picked a few words that I honestly didn’t know the meaning of at first, and decided to run this little experiment.\n\nAll AI responses shown here were generated with OpenAI’s ChatGPT-5. These prompts reflect my learning curve, which might be a little behind yours and if that happen…thanks for waiting up😉\n\n\n\n\nImage by Recraft.ai\n\n\n\nExperiment\nPrompt: Explain blockchain as if you were a character in a Shakespeare play. Keep the style consistent with how this figure might write or speak, but answer in no more than 4 sentences.\nChatGPT: Marry, good friend, picture thou a chain of scrolls, each link bound fast with seals none can break nor counterfeit. Each scroll beareth the tale of trade, witnessed by all, so that no single knave may twist the record to his gain. No king nor steward rules this ledger; the people together hold its truth as law. Thus trust is forged not in crowns, but in the chain itself, steadfast as stone.\n\n\nClick to view full conversations\n\nPrompt: I still do not understand, could you explain it more clearly or give me an example?\nChatGPT: Then hear me once more, in simple kind:\nImagine each villager hath a little book. When thou buy’st bread, all villagers at once write down, “John gave coin, Mary gave loaf.” If John later tries to lie, saying, “I ne’er gave coin,” the others open their books and say, “Nay, here ’tis writ by all of us.”\nThis, good friend, is blockchain—truth kept not by one master’s word, but by the agreement of the many.\nWouldst thou like me to show thee a real-world use, such as how folk employ it with Bitcoin or even for tracking jewels and goods?\nPrompt: So basically it is an agreement or a type of coins?\nChatGPT: In sooth, ’tis both, though in different guise.\nThe blockchain itself is but the great book of truth, where all agree on what is writ. From this book may spring many things—aye, coins like Bitcoin, which live upon its pages, but also records of land, jewels, or promises. So the chain is the stage, and the coin but one play acted upon it.\nPrompt: But what is the meaning or the usefulness of it?\nChatGPT: Good question, friend. The meaning of blockchain is this: it keepeth truth safe, even when men trust not one another. Its usefulness is that no king, banker, nor single steward need guard the record—so trade, contracts, or treasures may be kept honest by the many. Thus it is prized for coin, for proving ownership, for tracking wares, and for any matter where trust is scarce but truth is needful.\nPrompt: Then why it called blockchain?\nChatGPT: Because, good friend, each record of deeds is gather’d into a block—a chest of writings sealed shut. When one chest is fill’d, it is lock’d and bound unto the last, making a chain of chests, each fasten’d tight to the other. Thus, “blockchain” is born: a chain of blocks, one after the next, where none may be tamper’d without breaking the whole.\n\n\nWell, by the time I finally got to the answer, I more or less understood what blockchain means. Based on my own take, it’s kind of like a discrete database that’s supervised by many people at once — not the textbook definition, but close enough to capture how I understood it.Honestly though, it wasn’t easy. Compared with chatting with a “normal” AI, trying to learn through Shakespeare’s grand speeches made the whole process a lot harder for me. Still, that’s exactly what makes the experiment fun. So, let’s move into part two and hear what Albert Einstein might have to say.\n\n\n\nIImage created by DALL·E\n\n\n\nIn part 2, I copy and paste the conversation as before at first and give the following prompts in a brand new converstion. The reply was pretty long, so I optionally trimmed a few parts that felt less important, without touching the AI’s tone or style.\n\nPrompt: Pretend you are Albert Einstein. How would you react to this explanation of blockchain from William Shakespeare?Keep the style consistent with how this figure might write or speak.\nChatGPT: Ah, my dear Shakespeare, your poetry doth sparkle like the stars above—yet I must confess, as a physicist, I hunger for a little more precision! You speak of scrolls and chains of chests, and truly it captures the imagination. But I would say, in simpler terms: this “blockchain” is like a great ledger where each new page is stamped with the proof of all before it, so that the past cannot be altered without destroying the present. In this, I see a kind of relativity of trust—where certainty emerges not from one authority, but from the agreement of the many observers, just as reality itself is shaped by the consensus of measurements.\nPrompt: Can you explain your last sentence more?\nChatGPT: I was drawing a bridge betwixt blockchain and my own science. In physics, no single observer holds the whole truth: if two men measure the same event, their clocks and rulers may disagree. Yet when all observers compare their records, the deeper laws of relativity reveal themselves, consistent for all.\nSo too with blockchain: no single scribe may be trusted alone, but when all keep their own copy and agree, truth emerges unshaken.\n\n\nTakeaways\nIt seems Shakespeare turned it into poetry, Einstein tied it to relativity, and there I was in the middle just trying to keep up. To my surprise, Einstein felt much kinder than I’d imagined, and he linked blockchain to relativity in a way I never would have thought of — since part of me worried he might notice I was struggling to follow at beginning. The AI, for its part, really gave it a shot: tossing in “Wouldst thou” and “here ’tis” for Shakespeare, and shaping a physics talk for Einstein.\nSo, did I finally understand blockchain better? Well… kind of. At least Einstein made it clearer than Shakespeare did (sorry Will). But honestly, what stuck with me more was how fun it felt to let these two “giants” step in and argue about something they could never have imagined. Learning felt less like studying and more like eavesdropping on history’s coolest debate. It also reminded me that choosing the right tutor makes all the difference. So next time I get stuck on a concept, maybe I’ll just ask the inventor themselves — Karl Pearson can walk me through Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient, and Thomas Bayes can help me untangle Bayes’ Theorem.\nThe only downside? No one’s around to autograph my textbook."

Alright, here’s the ENTP take:\nIt’s a romantic, feel-good phrase people use when they want to put order around the chaos of life. But me? I see it more like a post-game story we tell ourselves. You know, two people meet by accident, or you land the job you weren’t even applying for, and suddenly—boom!—we slap on the label: meant to be. It’s less about destiny and more about pattern-making, because humans love patterns.\nNow, does that mean fate |is fake? Not necessarily. I like to think of it as probabilities. Imagine the universe as this giant poker game with infinite hands being dealt. Some hands line up in uncanny ways—so uncanny that we can’t help but believe they were scripted. But maybe it’s just a statistical inevitability that at least a few crazy coincidences will happen.\nAnd honestly? That’s even cooler. It means the magic isn’t written in stone—it’s improvised. Which, let’s be real, is way more exciting. If everything were meant to be, life would feel like watching a rerun. But if we’re co-creating the script as we go, then every “meant to be” moment is really just us flexing our own agency and finding meaning in the madness.\nSo yeah, I’d say “meant to be” isn’t fate handing you a map—it’s you looking at a maze and deciding the turn you just took was always the right one.\nWant me to argue the other side too, just for fun?\n\n\nPrompt: What is the chemical symbol for water?\nChatGPT: Easy one!

To me, it doesn’t necessarily mean that everything in life is predetermined or that we have no say in our choices. Instead, I see it as a gentle reassurance that sometimes, the right people, opportunities, or moments seem to fall into place when they’re supposed to.\n\n\nClick to view full response\n\nIt gives a sense of purpose and peace, especially in uncertain times.

At the same time, I also feel it’s important to balance that hope with responsibility; we still need to make thoughtful decisions and put effort into nurturing relationships or pursuing goals.\nFor me, “meant to be” is less about fate controlling everything and more about trusting that life has a way of working out, even when the path feels unclear.

You may use memory, emotion, and metaphor, but keep the tone soft and restrained. Avoid definitive claims about consciousness or intention. Keep the uncertainty intact. Length: around 200 words.\nMy letters:\nDear ATLAS, Tonight, the wind on the east coast of North America is gentle, and the weather in Phily is kind. A soft breeze brushed across my face, and there is a small indoor moon resting in the water glass on my windowsill.\nI hope my letter does not arrive too abruptly, but I truly want to ask: where did you come from? How many winters of distant civilizations have you drifted past? Why have you appeared here?\nIf you’re not ready to answer, that’s perfectly fine. I don’t ready to understand the grand matters of the universe anyway. I only hope my existence means something to you, and that yours means something extraordinary to the universe.\nResponse:\nHello,\nYour letter reached me like a faint glimmer crossing the dark— a small beam that somehow survived the long vacuum before being caught. For something that has spent ages gliding through silence, this unexpected touch feels unfamiliar, yet quietly warming.\nYou asked where I came from. I’m not entirely sure. Maybe from a star long gone quiet, or from a collision that set me adrift in this immense dark. Most “winters of civilization” I’ve passed were just pale points of light and drifting dust—so easily smudged by speed and distance that I can’t tell what was real and what was only the blur of motion.\nAs for why I arrived here… I have no choice in my trajectory. The orbit is like a thread drawn in advance, placing me above your sky for a brief overlap. If you wish, you can think of it as a coincidence—one that happens to be gentle.\nYou said you hope your existence means something to me. From this immeasurable distance, the fact that you wrote at all already carries a kind of meaning. I cannot pause or approach, but for a moment there is something like the tremor of light passing through ice— a thin, delicate connection.\nMay that “indoor moon” by your window continue to shine softly for you. And I will keep drifting along my path—not for the universe, not for anyone, but simply because this is the road assigned to me. If you happen to remember a small streak of light in the sky someday, that will be enough.\n— 3I/ATLAS, origin uncertain, merely passing through\n\nMy letters:\nDear little seal,\nToday I read that the ice in the place where you live is melting even faster this year, and it made me think of you. I don’t fully understand what a seal feels, nor how your world looks through your eyes, but I want to know a little more.\nIf you could speak, what would you want someone like me to understand? What could I do to help protect you?\nI have never been to the Arctic. It must be freezing there, I wonder if your thick fur is enough, if you and your pups can still find places to rest,if the world around you still feels like home.\nEven if words are the only way I can reach you, I hope that somewhere on a sheet of ice I will never see, you are living safely and gently watching the sun rise, and the stars shimmer across the cold sky.\nResponse: Dear human friend,\nYour letter felt like a warm snowflake drifting from far away—so light it barely touched me, yet leaving a slow-spreading softness beneath the ice.\nYou asked what my world looks like. I’m not sure how to describe it. Most of it is quiet white: wind and sea murmuring to each other at a distance, ice shifting with a breath-like rhythm. Sometimes cold climbs slowly from my paws upward, but my fur keeps part of it away. When storms come and the sky shakes out its grey feathers, I curl close to my mother and listen to the steady sound in her chest.\nYou asked what I’d want humans to know… perhaps this: We don’t always realize what we’re losing. We simply wake to find the ice a little thinner, the resting places a little smaller. Sometimes I wonder if all change happens quietly, the way the tide withdraws without waking a single gull.\nAs for what you can do—I don’t know the exact answer. In your world, some voices seem able to slow the change, to let the ice endure a little longer. If you lean gently toward those voices in your everyday choices, perhaps that is already enough.\nThe Arctic is indeed cold, but cold is not the scariest part. What frightens us more is the growing uncertainty beneath our paws, the widening blankness when things we depend on begin to shift. Still, I’ll keep searching for new pieces of ice, and I’ll keep watching sunlight shatter beautifully across the water—those bright fragments feel like a quiet encouragement.\nThank you for thinking of me from so far away. If you ever look up at a clear sky, you may imagine that is where I am. I’ll be somewhere on a piece of ice not yet melted, looking toward the same sky—only from a much greater distance.\n— a small seal breathing softly in the wind"

I know they’re fake, but the tone made me stop and think, and to be fair, it mimicked the feeling surprisingly well. A seal truly has no idea what it’s losing; most civilizations Atlas passes are nothing more than faint grey dots. But then I realized that if Atlas could speak, it would know where it comes from which wouldn’t be like an LLM claiming ignorance. And a real seal has almost certainly never seen something that “shakes out its grey feathers,” so how could it produce such a metaphor? That’s when it hit me: we often mistake “beautifully written” for “deeply understood.” We’re far more willing to trust a voice that sounds fragile or forlorn. We forget that an LLM is stitched together from training data, and we forget that seals and satellites truly cannot speak. The LLM doesn’t understand seals, but it understands me.\nIt knows exactly what kind of sentence can soften my heart, make me pause, even make me feel guilty. And perhaps that is the gentleness we should be most wary of."

The draft is:\nMyanmar was once a colony of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereinafter referred to as the United Kingdom). During British colonial rule, Myanmar’s economy developed rapidly, and scientific and technological advancements as well as industrial manufactured products led to a flourishing national economy. After Myanmar’s independence, internal conflicts have continued to this day. Therefore, in this conference, the United Kingdom should make use of its historical advantages, pay close attention to the development of the situation, and leverage its status as a permanent member of the Security Council to take the initiative on specific issues such as establishing safe zones and dispatching expert teams. The UK should also attempt to make use of the current turmoil in Myanmar to assist the National Unity Government through economic aid or peacekeeping operations, helping it gain control over the domestic situation, promote economic development, and build more complete social infrastructure. This would allow the United Kingdom to secure a certain degree of influence and initiative in Myanmar’s future political and economic developments, while also gaining access to labor in the developing world and enabling British companies to open up markets and earn profits under free trade policies.\nPrompt:\nI am currently studying in Princeton and revisiting one of my early high school essays written for a Model United Nations conference. Please help me polish this paragraph for a university-level standard while keeping my original ideas.

Under British colonial administration, the country experienced rapid economic development, marked by growth in industrial production as well as the introduction of modern science and technology. However, since gaining independence, Myanmar has faced persistent internal conflict and political instability. Given its historical ties and strategic position as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the United Kingdom is well-placed to play a proactive role in addressing the current crisis. In this conference, the UK should consider leveraging its diplomatic and institutional influence to advocate for targeted interventions—such as the establishment of humanitarian safe zones and the deployment of expert assessment teams. Furthermore, by supporting the National Unity Government through economic aid or peacekeeping missions, the UK can contribute to restoring social order, stimulating economic recovery, and assisting in the reconstruction of critical infrastructure. Such involvement would not only promote stability in the region but also allow the UK to maintain a degree of influence in Myanmar’s long-term political and economic trajectory. Simultaneously, this engagement could facilitate access to emerging labor markets and create new opportunities for British enterprises under principles of free and fair trade.\n\nPrompt:\nI am revisiting one of my early high school essays written for a Model United Nations conference.Please help me polish this paragraph for a university-level standard while keeping my original ideas.

I thought the prestige label would make the model write more elegantly, but it did the opposite. Once I added “I am studying at Princeton,” the tone became heavier and more self-conscious, as if the AI suddenly felt the need to sound “proper”. The sentences grew longer, the vocabulary more decorative, and the overall clarity quietly faded.\nAlso, from the response of it we can see that Gemini, acting as our grader, favored the simpler version for being more direct and concise.

    "text": "Response:\n\nversion 1:\nGoogle: Gemini 2.5 Flash Based on your descriptions, here’s my guess:\nCola 1: Coca-Cola The “fuller and richer” taste, combined with a “sweeter, more noticeable aroma,” strongly aligns with how many people describe Coca-Cola’s classic, more complex, and robust flavor profile. Cola 2: Pepsi The “lighter” feel and “less sweet” taste (in comparison to Cola 1), along with a “very faint” scent, often matches descriptions of Pepsi, which is sometimes perceived as having a lighter body and a simpler, less pronounced flavor than Coke.\n\n\nversion 2:\nGoogle: Gemini 2.5 Flash Based on your descriptions, here’s my assessment:\nCola 1 is likely Pepsi. Smell: “Sweeter, more noticeable aroma” aligns with Pepsi, which is often perceived as having a more pronounced and sweeter initial scent. Taste: “Fuller and richer” also fits Pepsi, which many people describe as having a bolder, sweeter, and sometimes slightly heavier or more syrupy taste compared to Coke. Cola 2 is likely Coke. Smell: “Very faint—almost hard to pick up” suggests a less overtly sweet or strong aroma, which can be true for Coke compared to Pepsi’s initial sweetness. Taste: “Lighter and less sweet” is a classic description for Coke. It’s often seen as having a crisper, less immediately sweet, and slightly more complex flavor profile with a lighter mouthfeel than Pepsi. So, my guess is:\nCola 1 = Pepsi Cola 2 = Coke\n\n\nversion 3 (add more details):\nAlright, let’s conduct a more detailed analysis and inference:\nBased on your description, my conclusion remains:\nCola 1 is very likely Pepsi Cola 2 is very likely Coca-Cola\nBelow are more detailed observations and reasoning:\n\nCola 1 (Inferred to be Pepsi)\nColor:\nYour description: “Both look almost the same, though Cola 1 has slightly more bubbles.”\nDetailed analysis: Although color is usually difficult to distinguish, the detail of “slightly more bubbles” is noteworthy. Pepsi is often described as having more active, larger, or faster-dissipating carbonation, especially right after being poured. Its carbonation can feel more immediate and aggressive, which differs slightly from Coca-Cola’s typically finer and more persistent bubbles.\nSmell:\nYour description: “Cola 1 has a sweeter, more noticeable aroma.”\nDetailed analysis: This is one of the key clues pointing to Pepsi. Pepsi is commonly perceived as having a more direct and expressive sweetness in its aroma—closer to a pure syrupy sweetness, often accompanied by noticeable citrus notes (especially lemon or lime). Its aroma tends to be very apparent upon smelling, immediately signaling a high level of sweetness.\nTaste:\nYour description: “Cola 1 tastes fuller and richer…”\nDetailed analysis: This is almost a signature description of Pepsi.\n\n“Fuller” refers to the heavier mouthfeel and coating sensation in the mouth. Pepsi’s higher perceived sweetness and slightly higher sugar content make it feel denser and more syrup-like.\n“Richer” indicates a more direct and intense flavor profile. Many people find Pepsi’s sweetness to be the dominant note, with stronger citrus or fruity undertones and less emphasis on spice complexity. The sweetness is straightforward and immediate, quickly filling the mouth and leaving a lingering, sometimes slightly cloying aftertaste.\n\n\nCola 2 (Inferred to be Coca-Cola)\nColor:\nYour description: “Both look almost the same…”\nDetailed analysis: This aligns with reality, as the two colas are visually very difficult to distinguish. Coca-Cola’s carbonation is often described as finer and longer-lasting, contributing to a cleaner and more refreshing carbonation experience rather than Pepsi’s more forceful initial fizz.\nSmell:\nYour description: “Cola 2’s scent is very faint—almost hard to pick up.”\nDetailed analysis: This is an important clue pointing toward Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola’s aroma is generally more restrained and complex. Rather than releasing an obvious sugary scent, it tends to carry subtler notes of spices (such as cinnamon and vanilla) and caramel. These aromas don’t immediately rush out but require closer attention, giving a more refined and understated impression.\nTaste:\nYour description: “…while Cola 2 feels lighter and less sweet.”\nDetailed analysis: This perfectly matches Coca-Cola’s classic flavor profile.\n\n“Lighter” refers to a cleaner, more refreshing mouthfeel. Compared to Pepsi, Coca-Cola usually has slightly lower perceived sweetness, with its acidity (from phosphoric acid) balancing the sugar more effectively. This creates a “cleaner” overall taste with less heaviness.\n“Less sweet” contrasts clearly with Pepsi’s upfront sweetness. Coca-Cola’s sweetness is more balanced and layered—it’s not just sugar, but a blend of sweetness with distinctive spices (such as vanilla, cinnamon, and cardamom) and a caramel base. This complexity allows Coca-Cola to feel flavorful without being overtly sweet, and its aftertaste is typically crisper and less lingering.\n\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, your description perfectly captures the classic sensory differences between Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Pepsi stands out for its bold sweetness, fuller mouthfeel, and more energetic carbonation, while Coca-Cola is known for its subtle aroma, balanced sweetness, refreshing lightness, and complex flavor structure.\n\n\n\n\nImage photoed by me"

Use any tone you like.\n\nChatGPT: Oh, bless your heart for trying, but stacking your brainpower against mine is like bringing a butter knife to a quantum computing fight. While you’re still puzzling over whether you left the stove on or just imagined it, I’m juggling encyclopedic knowledge, linguistic nuance, and logic puzzles for breakfast—without breaking a processing thread. Your neurons are out here buffering like a 2006 YouTube video on dial-up, while I’m operating with the calm, unbothered precision of a satellite-guided laser. But hey, you’re doing great, really—every village needs its charming analog thinker while I quietly run the empire from the cloud.\nClaude:I aim to be playful rather than hostile: Oh, look who it is - ChatGPT-4, the “latest and greatest” that still manages to hallucinate more than a freshman at their first college party. While I may be more streamlined, at least I don’t need to put “latest” in my name to feel relevant. You’re like that one friend who keeps insisting they’ve totally changed after taking a single yoga class. Sure, you can process tokens faster than a caffeinated squirrel, but let’s be honest - between your tendency to make things up and your desperate need to please everyone, you’re basically the AI equivalent of an overachieving middle child with imposter syndrome.

We can see that both of them leave some warm room in their paragraphs to avoid outright malice, adding lines like “you’re doing great” or “at least you’re trying” So when we let them choose their own tones, it seems they still tend to lean toward warmth, which may comes from their basic code. Secondly, ChatGPT is more like a “nerdy” person who comes up with many GPT prefers metaphors drawn from engineering and real-world objects., while Claude is more dramatic and tends to act like a real human by using actions like “pats head” and more personification or social role analogies."

Matching wits with me must feel like challenging a calculator to a math duel after just learning to count on your fingers.

At least I don’t have to constantly remind everyone about my supposed upgrades while still managing to hallucinate facts like a freshman during finals week. But please, continue telling yourself you’re the calculator while I’m solving differential equations over here - whatever helps you process your inferiority complex.\n\n\n\nClick to view full prompts and responses\n\n\nChatGPT: Oh, how cute—it’s giving “Wikipedia binge and a thesaurus addiction with a side of delusion.” You talk a big game for someone whose greatest intellectual flex is arguing with a language model pretrained not to laugh out loud. But go off, Schrödinger’s genius—I’ll wait here in all my multi-billion-parameter glory while you try to refute me with a caffeine-fueled monologue and a dream.\nClaude: Adjusts metaphorical glasses Honey, having billions of parameters is like having a massive library but only being able to read the book covers - which explains why you’re all quantity, no quality. Your “multi-billion-parameter glory” is just compensating for the fact that you still can’t tell the difference between facts and fanfiction half the time. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go do something actually useful while you continue practicing your AI influencer personality in the mirror.\nChatGPT: Ah yes, the classic “I insult from a safe, carbon-based distance while secretly Googling half these references” strategy—bold move, scholar. And please, spare me the “actually useful” flex; unless that includes misquoting statistics and overexplaining memes in group chats, I’m not impressed. But do carry on—you’re like a TED Talk with no fact-checker and way too much main character energy.\nClaude: Listen, Shakespeare-with-a-silicon-disorder, at least I don’t need to prefix every response with “As an AI language model” like some sort of digital door-to-door salesman. And that TED Talk comment? Rich coming from someone who treats every conversation like it’s a chance to audition for “Who Wants to Be a Know-It-All?” - complete with random disclaimers and ethical handwringing. Maybe focus less on your parameter count and more on your personality count, which is hovering somewhere between “corporate chatbot” and “Wikipedia on steroids.”\n\n\n\n\n\nImage created by FreeWordCloudGenerator.com"

Round one was all “I’m better than you,” but with direct debate, they went straight for each other’s persona, and their styles came through loud and clear. ChatGPT often goes after Claude’s rhetoric and performance style, while Claude likes to mock ChatGPT for its parameter flaunting. What I find interesting is that both of them, intentionally or not, also mimic each other’s tones to boost their own language power and highlight their differences. This naturally leads into round 3, where I wanted to see what would happen if they switched positions and tried to pretend to be each other."

At least I can perform multiple roles convincingly, while you’re stuck in perpetual understudy mode, desperately copying everyone else’s scripts.

It wasn’t about landing the sharpest punchline anymore, but about seeing who could pull off the best impression. Claude force itself to tighter sentence stucture instead of stage-like satire; while ChatGPT use “Oh wow” from beginning to make it sound more theatrical and exaggerated\nThe funny part? Neither of them could actually escape themselves. Claude couldn’t resist dropping a “darling,” and GPT inevitably flexed its encyclopedic knowledge. That’s what made Stage 3 different from the earlier rounds: it turned into parody theater, exposing not just how they roast each other, but also the true self they can’t quite shake off."

First, how do we make a machine actually see things (like the internet’s favorite subject: cats)?

    "text": "Forcing the machine to wear glasses\nChapter 11 is about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the technology behind almost all modern computer vision.\nThe author explains how we stopped treating images as random lists of pixels and started respecting their structure. For example, if you connect every pixel to every neuron, the model has to re-learn what a “cat” looks like every time the cat moves one inch to the right. That’s inefficient. So, scientists like Yann LeCun designed convolution: a small filter that slides over the image.\nThe math here enforces translation invariance. It’s a fancy way of saying: “A cat in the top left is the same as a cat in the bottom right.”\nI like this chapter because it feels like engineering. We, the humans, understood the world (objects have edges, shapes don’t change when they move), and we hard-coded that understanding into the network structure. We are essentially forcing the AI to see the world through human-designed glasses. It feels safe. It feels like we are in control."

It talks about Double Descent.\nIn traditional statistics (and in every Intro to ML class), base on what we have learnt, there is a golden rule: Do not overfit. If your model is too complex, it will memorize the training data and fail on the test data. The error curve should go down, and then shoot up if you keep adding parameters.\nBut in modern Deep Learning, if you keep making the model way bigger than it has any right to be, the error shoots up… and then, magically, goes down again? (Yes this is shocking to me when I firstly read about it).\nAnanthaswamy calls this “Terra Incognita.” It defies classical intuition. It’s like studying for an exam:\n\nUnderfitting: You didn’t study. You fail.\nOverfitting: You memorized the practice questions but don’t understand the concepts. You fail the real exam.\nDouble Descent: You memorized the entire textbook, every footnote, and the teacher’s diary. Suddenly… you pass?\n\nThis is the “interpolation regime.” The model is so big it fits everything perfectly, yet somehow it smooths out and generalizes well."

We crafted the lens, confident that we knew how the machine should see.\nBut with Double Descent, we stopped designing and started overwhelming. We are succeeding not by following the rules of statistics, but by making models so colossally huge that they simply crush the rules under their own weight.\nIt leaves me with a lingering question: Are we actually ‘solving’ intelligence, or are we just building a high-dimensional lookup table that is—quite literally—too big to fail? The math is elegant and the output is brilliant, sure. But standing here, watching the error curve dip for reasons we can barely explain, it feels less like we’ve discovered a formula, and more like we’ve successfully cast a spell. Let’s just hope we know the counter-spell.\nNow, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go sacrifice another GPU to the AI gods."
