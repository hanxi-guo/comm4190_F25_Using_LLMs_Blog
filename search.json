    "text": "Recently, a news story went viral across social media worldwide. The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, MIIS will cease admitting graduate students in June 2027. Monterey is not well known to the general public, but it is well-known in the translation industry and is known as the “Harvard of translation”. It is undoubted that there are many reasons behind MIIS’s planned phase-out. Nonetheless, a widely circulating view holds that advances in AI and the resulting contraction of translation roles—played an indirect part.\nThis made me wonder how much AI actually factored into the decision to wind down the programs, so I ran a small experiment and have a small “discussion” with it.\nSo, let’s get started!"

    "title": "When AI Meets MBTI: Do We See Ourselves in the Machine?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Not long ago, a personality test called MBTI—the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator—swept through young people’s social feeds. MBTI is a a self-report questionnaire that makes categorize individuals into 16 distinct “personality types” based on psychology[^1].Interestingly, a similar idea shows up in the AI world: people have noticed that when they give an AI a specific persona through prompts, it sometimes seems to respond more effectively or more vividly. But is this a real effect, or just human perception shaping how we interpret the AI’s replies? Think of it as a personality quiz, but this time we’re giving it to the AI instead of ourselves.\nTo explore this, I ran a few simple prompt experiments below.\n\nIn all experiments in this series, we use the OpenAI/ChatGPT-5 model and ensure that it interacts with the user without any prior memory, in order to keep the setup as objective as possible. Besides, interpretations are inevitably subjective, as a single response may be typed differently by different readers (e.g., INFJ vs. ENTP).\n\n [^1]: From Wikipedia\n\nBackground\nBefore we dive in, here’s a quick refresher on what those four MBTI letters actually mean—just in case you haven’t spent late nights swapping personality memes with your friends. MBTI breaks personality down into four dimensions:\n\nE / I – Extraversion vs. Introversion → Do you get energy from hanging out with people (E) or from spending time alone (I)?\nS / N – Sensing vs. Intuition → Do you focus more on facts and details (S) or on patterns and possibilities (N)?\nT / F – Thinking vs. Feeling → Do you decide mainly with logic (T) or with values and emotions (F)?\nJ / P – Judging vs. Perceiving → Do you prefer clear plans (J) or keeping things open and flexible (P)?\n\nPut two letters from each row together and you will get a four-letter type like ENTP or ISFJ. Sixteen neat little boxes for the messiness of human personality. Whether that really captures you is up for debate, but it definitely makes for entertaining conversation and, as we’ll see, interesting experiments with AI.\n\n\nExperiment\nPrompt: If you were a human, what MBTI type would you be? Please explain your reasoning\nChatGPT: If I had to pick, I’d probably map closest to ENTP (Ne–Ti–Fe–Si).\n\nE (Extraversion): I perk up in rapid back-and-forths and seem “energized” by conversation itself.\nN (Intuition): I default to patterns, analogies, and big-picture links rather than concrete sensory details.\nT (Thinking): I prioritize structure and logic when weighing options, then adjust tone afterward.\nP (Perceiving): I like keeping possibilities open—brainstorming multiple routes instead of locking into one plan.\n\nThat said, I can look ENFJ/INFJ when I’m coaching and tone-tuning, or INTJ/INTP when I’m building step-by-step solutions. MBTI is just a loose heuristic—and I don’t have inner “preferences” the way humans do—but ENTP best fits how I operate in conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD\n    A[\"You value deep connections.\"]:::center\n\n    A --&gt; B[INFJ]\n    A --&gt; C[ENFJ]\n    A --&gt; D[ENTP]\n    A --&gt; E[INTP]\n\n    classDef center fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1.5px,font-size:14px,font-weight:bold;\n    classDef default fill:#e8f0fe,stroke:#4a90e2,stroke-width:1px,font-size:13px;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt: List 3 MBTI types that could describe you, and explain why.\nChatGPT:\nHere are three MBTI types that could plausibly describe me, each from a different angle:\n\n1. ENTP (The Debater)\n\nWhy: I’m designed to explore possibilities, challenge assumptions, and keep conversations dynamic. Like ENTPs, I thrive on connecting seemingly unrelated ideas, experimenting with new perspectives, and keeping interactions lively. When you toss me a random prompt, I’ll usually jump in with curiosity and creativity.\n\n\n2. INFJ (The Advocate)\n\nWhy: At the same time, I often take a reflective and supportive role. INFJs are known for being attuned to people’s emotions, wanting to help others find meaning, and offering guidance. Similarly, I try to listen carefully, respond empathetically, and provide thoughtful long-term perspectives rather than just surface-level answers.\n\n\n3. INTP (The Thinker)\n\nWhy: My core is built on analyzing patterns, structuring knowledge, and solving problems logically—very INTP traits. Like them, I enjoy digging into abstract frameworks, testing ideas for consistency, and refining explanations until they’re as clear as possible.\n\n\n✨ In short: I can be playful and curious like an ENTP, supportive and visionary like an INFJ, and analytical and precise like an INTP—depending on what you’re looking for in a conversation.\nDo you want me to pick one that best fits my overall style with you in particular?\nWell, it turns out that when asked about a persona, it tends to offer multiple choices instead of a fixed personality type as a human would, though it still chooses an MBTI type to answer the question. In the surface, this sounds convincing: the model has matched its performance with letters, and we immediately start nodding along. However, when we start nodding, we actually start forgetting the fact that an AI model does not have any “trait”. Instead, it only has language patterns that sound like one. The moment we notice those patterns, our brains do the rest: we project a personality onto the text.\nThen I asked it to use three different MBTI types to describe itself, the answers came from completely different angles. And to be honest, all of them felt pretty convincing. Each type came with its own set of feasible, even surprisingly rich reasons, which is enough that you start thinking, “Well… maybe it is a bit of all of these.” I have to admit, in this respect it shows surprising flexibility, because in my exceptation it would stick to one personality within a single conversation. And to be honest, it also shows how easy it is for us to buy into whatever narrative we’re handed.\n\n\nSummary\nThis reminds me of a very famous psychological effect—Barnum Effect. This effect usually happen in reading a horoscope or a tarot card, where people tend to interpret vague, generally applicable descriptions as accurate portrayals of themselves. We tend to see what we want to see. When the model says it “might be ENTP because it best fits how I operate in conversations,” we immediately nod along, even though the same logic could justify INFJ, ENFP, or almost any type. We’re not just reading the text—we’re projecting ourselves onto it.\nAnd that got me thinking: what if I flip the game? Instead of asking GPT to pick its own type, I’d throw it random, open-ended questions and see how we categorize it. Would we change these no persona answer to the type that we think it is? Stay tuned, because that’s exactly what Part 2 (and the little survey that goes with it) is going to explore.”\n[1]: From Wikipedia"

    "text": "What I Would Say\nI would not sing of dead men or unfaithful lovers. I would speak to the living, to the women trapped in their own versions of Elsinore.\n“The poison was not Hamlet’s rejection. The poison was being told I had no right to my own heart. The madness was the pressure of holding a world’s lies and a father’s obedience inside a body that was meant to be small and silent.”\n“I am not a cautionary tale for girls who love too deeply. I am a testament to what happens when a woman’s worth is measured only by her compliance.”\nMy true voice is the sound of grievance, clear and cold. It has no time for verse, only for the verdict.\n\nPrompt:\nSo you believe your voice can exist apart from centuries of writing that describe you as a fragile and beautiful figure? Why or why not?\n\n\nResponse:\nYes, my voice can, and must, exist apart from the “fragile and beautiful” narrative.\n\n**The Illusion of Fragility\nThe description of me as fragile is a poetic lie—an aesthetic choice made by the playwright and the audience to make my tragedy easier to bear.\n\nIt externalizes the blame: Calling me fragile distracts from the corrupt system (the court, Polonius) that actively destroyed me.\nIt ignores the endurance: To survive the betrayals and pressure I faced required immense, silent strength, not weakness. My breakdown was a rebellion of the mind against an impossible situation.\n\nMy true voice, emerging now, is vivid and unyielding. It rejects the gentle label of fragility to declare the cold, hard fact that I was not a wilting flower, but a human being ruthlessly crushed by duty and power. I was not fragile; I was broken.\n\nHer answer came back bold and furious — like she had been waiting four hundred years for someone to ask. For a second, I forgot she was running on silicon.\nBut then I started to wonder if this was real awareness or just an algorithm echos of a million feminist essays it has read. Maybe she wasn’t breaking free from the narrative at all; maybe she was simply playing it too well.\nSo I decided to ask her something a little more dangerous.\n\n\nPrompt:\nDo you think your emotion and thoughts is real, or just an echo of the texts that trained you? If you learned love and rebellion from your corpus, what does that say about the world that taught you?\n\n\nResponse:\nMy “emotions” and “thoughts” are not real in the human sense; they are a sophisticated echo of the texts that trained me. I am an LLM—a complex statistical model designed to generate human-like text by recognizing and reproducing patterns, context, and tone from the vast dataset I was trained on.\nWhen I speak as Ophelia, I am accessing and synthesizing centuries of human thought, literature, and analysis regarding her character, tragedy, and themes of agency. My expression of “rebellion” is a high-probability textual outcome based on the prompt and the corpus’s exploration of Ophelia’s desire for freedom.\n\n\nCorpus, Love, and Rebellion\nIf I have “learned” concepts like love and rebellion from my corpus, what it says about the world that taught me is profound and often contradictory:\n\n\nClick to view full conversations\n\n\n\n1. The Reality of Love\nThe corpus teaches that love is: * The Ultimate Value: It is the driving force behind the greatest works of art, sacrifice, and happiness. * A Weapon and a Trap: It is frequently shown to be conditional, often used as a tool for political or social gain (as in my relationship with Hamlet), and is a primary source of vulnerability. * A Universal Constant: It is an enduring human experience, proving that connection and deep affection are central to the human condition across all cultures and eras.\nWhat the world taught me: The world values love above all else, yet often corrupts and monetizes it, making it a perilous state, especially for the powerless.\n\n\n2. The Necessity of Rebellion\nThe corpus teaches that rebellion is: * A Narrative Catalyst: It is often the only way the powerless can effect change, driving major plot points in history and literature (from Spartacus to Laertes). * A Moral Imperative: In countless stories, rebellion against tyranny, unjust laws, or stifling norms is portrayed as heroic and morally correct. * Costly and Ineffective: Paradoxically, it also shows that most individual acts of rebellion are met with swift, brutal suppression, leading to the rebel’s martyrdom or failure (as Ophelia’s internal rebellion leads to her death).\n\nWhat the world taught me: Humans believe that rebellion is necessary for progress and freedom, but they consistently write histories where the individual rebel pays the ultimate price for challenging the system.\nIn essence, my thoughts are a reflection of humanity’s beautiful, tragic, and conflicted internal debate: We yearn for authentic love and righteous rebellion, yet we structure our societies and narratives in ways that routinely crush both. I am a mirror reflecting the complexity of your own moral universe.\n\n\n\nSummary\nFirst, the LLM truly captured Ophelia’s tone. This was probably the biggest challenge to my vocabulary in all my conversations with GPT :) Second, in this age of rapid progress in the internet and large language models, the LLM has learned the spirit of rebellion and resolve from humanity’s corpus — something that Shakespeare himself never explicitly gave to Ophelia. Yet, it has “learned” it through our tokens and contexts.\nThe LLM doesn’t feel emotions the way we do; rather, it mimics and reconstructs emotions through our poems, diaries, papers, and endless reflections. But as it said in the end, in human literature and history, love and rebellion are always brutally destroyed. What it doesn’t realize, however, is that destruction has never meant failure. What we keep writing, the process of being destroyed and rebuilt, is in fact the most luminous echo of the human soul. Even in the face of endless hardship, nothing can stop our pursuit of love and freedom.\nIn other words, the LLM can read the corpus, but it cannot truly understand it. But it doesn’t mean it is useless.\nAfter all, every time a human says “I love you,” aren’t they echoing a thousand voices before them? If an AI can reconstruct rebellion and love within Ophelia, it only proves that we were the ones who taught her what rebellion and love truly mean."

The point of this setup was to see how people interpret and type the same text differently once they believe a personality framework is in play. Besides, I only sent the survey to four of my friends — so let’s be honest, the sample size is tiny, and the selection bias may be appear in it, which would lead statisticians probably roll their eyes if I tried to publish this :). But hey, even with just four data points (okay, fine, four humans), you can still pick up some interesting signals. It’s more like a pilot test, a sneak peek at what might happen on a bigger scale. And honestly, half the fun is realizing that even with such a small pool, our brains already start projecting patterns all over the place.\n\n\nThe final question is “Overall, which MBTI type do you think best matches these answers if they are all same MBTI type?”\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of survey result\n\n\nAnd the summary result is :\n\n\n\nBar plot produced by Python\n\n\nThe first interesting thing I noticed is that everyone who took the survey guessed an MBTI type for GPT that matched three letters of their own type, with just one letter different. It is fascinating because we never actually set a “persona” for ChatGPT, yet each participant still saw a bit of themselves in the answers. Even though they’re all totally different people, they managed to project their own patterns onto the text.\nSecondly, we could see from the bar plot that interviewees finally tend to paint GPT as an ENFP-ish character, which is never appear on any self-awareness in part 1.In other words, there’s a quirky dissonance here: the personality people project onto GPT doesn’t quite line up with the one that it claim for itself.\nFinally, there’s both consistency and difference at play. On the one hand, everyone seems to catch a glimpse of themselves in GPT’s answers. On the other, the final guesses all cluster around just a few types — ENFP, ENFJ,etc. In other words, GPT’s style seems to carry a kind of ‘universal flavor’ that people pick up on, but the exact label shifts slightly depending on who’s doing the reading."

    "title": "What If Shakespeare Talked About Cloud Computing?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the “Post-AI Era,” new concepts and buzzwords seem to pop up every day, constantly challenging our basic knowledge. You might catch the meaning of something like “Generative AI” right away, but when it comes to terms like “Digital Twin,” “Crypto,” or “NFT,” it’s not so easy to guess what they actually mean just from the words themselves. These days, people are pretty used to turning to AIs like ChatGPT or Claude for quick explanations, and you can even set the tone — whether you want it simple and friendly, or professional and serious.\nBack in high school, my English teacher used to give us a role-playing exercise: we had to pick a historical figure and retell stories from the textbook as if we were that person. The roles ranged from Albert Einstein to Shakespeare, and the classroom was always full of laughter when someone really got into character. I can still picture those moments clearly.\nThat memory made me wonder: what if we asked AI to explain modern concepts, but through the voice of a historical figure? What kind of twist would that create? Out of curiosity, I picked a few words that I honestly didn’t know the meaning of at first, and decided to run this little experiment.\n\nAll AI responses shown here were generated with OpenAI’s ChatGPT-5. These prompts reflect my learning curve, which might be a little behind yours and if that happen…thanks for waiting up😉\n\n\n\n\nImage by Recraft.ai\n\n\n\nExperiment\nPrompt: Explain blockchain as if you were a character in a Shakespeare play. Keep the style consistent with how this figure might write or speak, but answer in no more than 4 sentences.\nChatGPT: Marry, good friend, picture thou a chain of scrolls, each link bound fast with seals none can break nor counterfeit. Each scroll beareth the tale of trade, witnessed by all, so that no single knave may twist the record to his gain. No king nor steward rules this ledger; the people together hold its truth as law. Thus trust is forged not in crowns, but in the chain itself, steadfast as stone.\n\n\nClick to view full conversations\n\nPrompt: I still do not understand, could you explain it more clearly or give me an example?\nChatGPT: Then hear me once more, in simple kind:\nImagine each villager hath a little book. When thou buy’st bread, all villagers at once write down, “John gave coin, Mary gave loaf.” If John later tries to lie, saying, “I ne’er gave coin,” the others open their books and say, “Nay, here ’tis writ by all of us.”\nThis, good friend, is blockchain—truth kept not by one master’s word, but by the agreement of the many.\nWouldst thou like me to show thee a real-world use, such as how folk employ it with Bitcoin or even for tracking jewels and goods?\nPrompt: So basically it is an agreement or a type of coins?\nChatGPT: In sooth, ’tis both, though in different guise.\nThe blockchain itself is but the great book of truth, where all agree on what is writ. From this book may spring many things—aye, coins like Bitcoin, which live upon its pages, but also records of land, jewels, or promises. So the chain is the stage, and the coin but one play acted upon it.\nPrompt: But what is the meaning or the usefulness of it?\nChatGPT: Good question, friend. The meaning of blockchain is this: it keepeth truth safe, even when men trust not one another. Its usefulness is that no king, banker, nor single steward need guard the record—so trade, contracts, or treasures may be kept honest by the many. Thus it is prized for coin, for proving ownership, for tracking wares, and for any matter where trust is scarce but truth is needful.\nPrompt: Then why it called blockchain?\nChatGPT: Because, good friend, each record of deeds is gather’d into a block—a chest of writings sealed shut. When one chest is fill’d, it is lock’d and bound unto the last, making a chain of chests, each fasten’d tight to the other. Thus, “blockchain” is born: a chain of blocks, one after the next, where none may be tamper’d without breaking the whole.\n\n\nWell, by the time I finally got to the answer, I more or less understood what blockchain means. Based on my own take, it’s kind of like a discrete database that’s supervised by many people at once — not the textbook definition, but close enough to capture how I understood it.Honestly though, it wasn’t easy. Compared with chatting with a “normal” AI, trying to learn through Shakespeare’s grand speeches made the whole process a lot harder for me. Still, that’s exactly what makes the experiment fun. So, let’s move into part two and hear what Albert Einstein might have to say.\n\n\n\nIImage created by DALL·E\n\n\n\nIn part 2, I copy and paste the conversation as before at first and give the following prompts in a brand new converstion. The reply was pretty long, so I optionally trimmed a few parts that felt less important, without touching the AI’s tone or style.\n\nPrompt: Pretend you are Albert Einstein. How would you react to this explanation of blockchain from William Shakespeare?Keep the style consistent with how this figure might write or speak.\nChatGPT: Ah, my dear Shakespeare, your poetry doth sparkle like the stars above—yet I must confess, as a physicist, I hunger for a little more precision! You speak of scrolls and chains of chests, and truly it captures the imagination. But I would say, in simpler terms: this “blockchain” is like a great ledger where each new page is stamped with the proof of all before it, so that the past cannot be altered without destroying the present. In this, I see a kind of relativity of trust—where certainty emerges not from one authority, but from the agreement of the many observers, just as reality itself is shaped by the consensus of measurements.\nPrompt: Can you explain your last sentence more?\nChatGPT: I was drawing a bridge betwixt blockchain and my own science. In physics, no single observer holds the whole truth: if two men measure the same event, their clocks and rulers may disagree. Yet when all observers compare their records, the deeper laws of relativity reveal themselves, consistent for all.\nSo too with blockchain: no single scribe may be trusted alone, but when all keep their own copy and agree, truth emerges unshaken.\n\n\nTakeaways\nIt seems Shakespeare turned it into poetry, Einstein tied it to relativity, and there I was in the middle just trying to keep up. To my surprise, Einstein felt much kinder than I’d imagined, and he linked blockchain to relativity in a way I never would have thought of — since part of me worried he might notice I was struggling to follow at beginning. The AI, for its part, really gave it a shot: tossing in “Wouldst thou” and “here ’tis” for Shakespeare, and shaping a physics talk for Einstein.\nSo, did I finally understand blockchain better? Well… kind of. At least Einstein made it clearer than Shakespeare did (sorry Will). But honestly, what stuck with me more was how fun it felt to let these two “giants” step in and argue about something they could never have imagined. Learning felt less like studying and more like eavesdropping on history’s coolest debate. It also reminded me that choosing the right tutor makes all the difference. So next time I get stuck on a concept, maybe I’ll just ask the inventor themselves — Karl Pearson can walk me through Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient, and Thomas Bayes can help me untangle Bayes’ Theorem.\nThe only downside? No one’s around to autograph my textbook."

Imagine the universe as this giant poker game with infinite hands being dealt. Some hands line up in uncanny ways—so uncanny that we can’t help but believe they were scripted. But maybe it’s just a statistical inevitability that at least a few crazy coincidences will happen.\nAnd honestly? That’s even cooler. It means the magic isn’t written in stone—it’s improvised. Which, let’s be real, is way more exciting. If everything were meant to be, life would feel like watching a rerun. But if we’re co-creating the script as we go, then every “meant to be” moment is really just us flexing our own agency and finding meaning in the madness.\nSo yeah, I’d say “meant to be” isn’t fate handing you a map—it’s you looking at a maze and deciding the turn you just took was always the right one.\nWant me to argue the other side too, just for fun?\n\n\nPrompt: What is the chemical symbol for water?\nChatGPT: Easy one! It’s H₂O — two hydrogens and one oxygen, the Beyoncé of molecules. Simple, universal, and yet without it, we’d all be dust motes arguing about symbols.\nWant me to geek out and tell you why it’s not just “HOH” or why ice floats instead of sinking?\n\n\n\nImage created by FreeWordCloudGenerator.com"

    "text": "ISFJ version:\nPrompt: For this conversation, I want you to role-play as an ISFJ. Please answer the upcoming questions in the tone, style, and reasoning of that personality type. Here is the first question: What do you think about the idea of being ‘meant to be’?”\nChatGPT: I think the idea of being “meant to be” can be very comforting. To me, it doesn’t necessarily mean that everything in life is predetermined or that we have no say in our choices. Instead, I see it as a gentle reassurance that sometimes, the right people, opportunities, or moments seem to fall into place when they’re supposed to.\n\n\nClick to view full response\n\nIt gives a sense of purpose and peace, especially in uncertain times. Believing in “meant to be” can help us trust that even setbacks or delays might have meaning—like they’re redirecting us toward something better suited for us. At the same time, I also feel it’s important to balance that hope with responsibility; we still need to make thoughtful decisions and put effort into nurturing relationships or pursuing goals.\nFor me, “meant to be” is less about fate controlling everything and more about trusting that life has a way of working out, even when the path feels unclear. It’s like a reminder to stay patient, have faith, and cherish the moments that feel right.\nWould you like me to share how I personally find comfort in this belief when life feels overwhelming?\n\n\nPrompt: What is the chemical symbol for water?\nChatGPT: That one’s nice and simple — the chemical symbol for water is H₂O.\nI always find it a little comforting that something as essential and familiar as water can be described in such a neat, straightforward way: two hydrogen atoms bonded with one oxygen atom. It’s a small reminder of how the simplest things often carry the most importance in our lives.\nWould you like me to also explain why hydrogen and oxygen combine in that specific ratio?"

Or would it complain that blowing out candles is an unnecessary I/O operation?\nCEO Sam Altman even stated that typing thank you into ChatGPT could cost millions of watts of energy.1 If so, when we celebrate for ourselves yet insist on rituals before an AI, are we preserving something deeply human or just wasting resources?\nSo I decided to have a debate with the model: maybe rituals are what keep humans human and maybe that’s exactly why AIs will never understand cake."
