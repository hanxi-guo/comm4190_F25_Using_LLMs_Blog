    "During fall break, I took a small trip to Princeton. The air was clear and a little cold, and I had no plan for the day. I sat in a caf√© near the train station and opened the chat window, half out of curiosity, half out of boredom. I typed a simple request: give me four inspirations for how to explore this small town. The AI replied instantly, as if it had been waiting for the question. Its suggestions were ordinary yet oddly specific. I decided to follow them all, one by one, and see which moment would stay with me the longest."

    "\n",
    "In Reality:\n",
    "My first stop was Nassau Hall. I walked slowly along the old stone walls, leaves crunching under my shoes. It‚Äôs fall now, and the trees have turned a deep golden hue. Everything felt calm, almost ceremonial. Emerald ivy clung to the walls as if it had been growing there for centuries, maybe that's why we call princeton as one of ivy leagueüòâ?  The bronze tigers lay quietly by the entrance, and the American flag waved gently above the doorway. There was a sense of quiet, timeless strength in the air.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Reality:\n",
    "Firestone smelled like paper and ink. Rows of lamps glowed, each lighting someone‚Äôs little universe of notes and coffee cups. I sat for an hour without touching my phone, and it felt like time paused politely for me. It seems has magic to let person focus.\n",

    "Answer: Sit by Cannon Green. It‚Äôs where friends meet, traditions unfold, and the spirit of campus community thrives between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Reality:\n",
    "**Well, this is a bit awkward: Cannon Green is just behind Nassau Hall, so I had to loop back. It‚Äôs interesting that an LLM didn‚Äôt point that out; it really only does what we ask it to.**\n",
    "At Cannon Green, a gentle breeze drifted by, and sunlight filtered softly through the gaps between the leaves. A few students were eating sandwiches, some half-talking, half-dozing in the warmth. I didn‚Äôt know anyone, but I felt completely at ease, immersed and relaxed.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Reality:\n",
    "**This tip didn‚Äôt even work for me: the museum‚Äôs already closed!** I guess this suggestion must‚Äôve come from the LLM‚Äôs training data and wasn‚Äôt updated in time, so even if I added ‚Äúnow‚Äù in the prompt, it couldn‚Äôt reflect the current situation. Still, the scenery around the museum was beautiful. Maybe that‚Äôs a reminder that following an LLM‚Äôs advice doesn‚Äôt always lead to practical results? But life, after all, is about finding unexpected joys along the way.\n",

    "The LLM guided my steps with reason, yet beauty waited in the pauses between its words. Princeton‚Äôs stones, the drifting leaves, the warmth of light, none were in its plan. Perhaps truth is not in perfect guidance, but in the quiet surprise of being slightly lost. And that's might be the reason why we are beteer than llms: because we don‚Äôt just follow instructions, we feel.\n"
