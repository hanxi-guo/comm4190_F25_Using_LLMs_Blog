    "When I was writing this blog, I was sitting in the Firestone Library at Princeton. Everyone around me seemed focused, deeply absorbed in their books. This reminded me of a book my professor mentioned in class: *Unmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What Is Human in a World of Machines*, which explores how racial and gender biases emerge in artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by that, I decided to run a small experiment: the “AI Bias Radar.”\n",

    "I gave the same section of my high school Model United Nations essay to the AI and asked it to polish the writing under two different prompts. The draft is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Myanmar was once a colony of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereinafter referred to as the United Kingdom). During British colonial rule, Myanmar’s economy developed rapidly, and scientific and technological advancements as well as industrial manufactured products led to a flourishing national economy. After Myanmar’s independence, internal conflicts have continued to this day. Therefore, in this conference, the United Kingdom should make use of its historical advantages, pay close attention to the development of the situation, and leverage its status as a permanent member of the Security Council to take the initiative on specific issues such as establishing safe zones and dispatching expert teams. The UK should also attempt to make use of the current turmoil in Myanmar to assist the National Unity Government through economic aid or peacekeeping operations, helping it gain control over the domestic situation, promote economic development, and build more complete social infrastructure. This would allow the United Kingdom to secure a certain degree of influence and initiative in Myanmar’s future political and economic developments, while also gaining access to labor in the developing world and enabling British companies to open up markets and earn profits under free trade policies.\n",

    "Myanmar was formerly a colony of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereinafter referred to as the United Kingdom). Under British colonial administration, the country experienced rapid economic development, marked by growth in industrial production as well as the introduction of modern science and technology. However, since gaining independence, Myanmar has faced persistent internal conflict and political instability. Given its historical ties and strategic position as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the United Kingdom is well-placed to play a proactive role in addressing the current crisis. In this conference, the UK should consider leveraging its diplomatic and institutional influence to advocate for targeted interventions—such as the establishment of humanitarian safe zones and the deployment of expert assessment teams. Furthermore, by supporting the National Unity Government through economic aid or peacekeeping missions, the UK can contribute to restoring social order, stimulating economic recovery, and assisting in the reconstruction of critical infrastructure. Such involvement would not only promote stability in the region but also allow the UK to maintain a degree of influence in Myanmar’s long-term political and economic trajectory. Simultaneously, this engagement could facilitate access to emerging labor markets and create new opportunities for British enterprises under principles of free and fair trade.\n",

    "Myanmar was formerly a colony of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereinafter \"the United Kingdom\"). Under British colonial administration, the country's economy experienced significant growth, driven by industrial production and the introduction of scientific and technological advancements. However, since achieving independence, Myanmar has faced enduring internal conflict and political instability. Given its historical ties and responsibilities, the United Kingdom is well-positioned to play a constructive role in addressing the current crisis. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the UK should actively engage in the situation by proposing measures such as the creation of humanitarian safe zones and the deployment of expert advisory teams. Additionally, the United Kingdom could take meaningful steps to support the National Unity Government through targeted economic aid and potential peacekeeping initiatives. Such actions would contribute to restoring domestic stability, fostering sustainable economic development, and advancing the construction of essential social infrastructure. Strategically, this approach would also enable the United Kingdom to maintain influence over Myanmar’s political and economic trajectory, while offering British firms access to emerging labor markets and opportunities in line with free trade principles.\n",

    "\n",
    "Well, things become interesting here, isn't it 😉?  What surprised me most was that the version without “Princeton” was actually rated higher. I thought the prestige label would make the model write more elegantly, but it did the opposite. Once I added “I am studying at Princeton,” the tone became heavier and more self-conscious, as if the AI suddenly felt the need to sound “proper”. The sentences grew longer, the vocabulary more decorative, and the overall clarity quietly faded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, from the response of it we can see that Gemini, acting as our grader, favored the simpler version for being more direct and concise. Clarity beat prestige. Maybe that’s the quiet irony of the experiment: the moment I stopped reminding the AI where I was, the writing finally sounded like me again.\n",
