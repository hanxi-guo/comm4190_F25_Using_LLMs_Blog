Sometimes the results read like research notes, sometimes like improv sketches, and often like a messy, lovable mix of both. It’s my way of turning technical ideas into things people actually want to read. If the robots ever gain consciousness, this will probably be Exhibit A in their complaint against me.\nWhy do this? Because every “AI dream,” whether it’s nonsense, poetry, or pure chaos, says something about how machines (and maybe humans) think. And because, honestly, it’s fun.\nSo stick around. There will be prompts, glitches, and maybe a few surprises."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, a news story went viral across social media worldwide. The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, MIIS will cease admitting graduate students in June 2027. Monterey is not well known to the general public, but it is well-known in the translation industry and is known as the “Harvard of translation”. It is undoubted that there are many reasons behind MIIS’s planned phase-out. Nonetheless, a widely circulating view holds that advances in AI and the resulting contraction of translation roles—played an indirect part.\nThis made me wonder how much AI actually factored into the decision to wind down the programs, so I ran a small experiment and have a small “discussion” with it.\nSo, let’s get started!"

Neither of them could actually escape themselves. Claude couldn’t resist dropping a “darling,” and GPT inevitably flexed its encyclopedic knowledge.

Alright, here’s the ENTP take:\nIt’s a romantic, feel-good phrase people use when they want to put order around the chaos of life. But me? I see it more like a post-game story we tell ourselves. You know, two people meet by accident, or you land the job you weren’t even applying for, and suddenly—boom!—we slap on the label: meant to be. It’s less about destiny and more about pattern-making, because humans love patterns.\nNow, does that mean fate |is fake? Not necessarily. I like to think of it as probabilities. Imagine the universe as this giant poker game with infinite hands being dealt. Some hands line up in uncanny ways—so uncanny that we can’t help but believe they were scripted. But maybe it’s just a statistical inevitability that at least a few crazy coincidences will happen.\nAnd honestly? That’s even cooler. It means the magic isn’t written in stone—it’s improvised. Which, let’s be real, is way more exciting. If everything were meant to be, life would feel like watching a rerun. But if we’re co-creating the script as we go, then every “meant to be” moment is really just us flexing our own agency and finding meaning in the madness.\nSo yeah, I’d say “meant to be” isn’t fate handing you a map—it’s you looking at a maze and deciding the turn you just took was always the right one.\nWant me to argue the other side too, just for fun?\n\n\nPrompt: What is the chemical symbol for water?\nChatGPT: Easy one!

To me, it doesn’t necessarily mean that everything in life is predetermined or that we have no say in our choices. Instead, I see it as a gentle reassurance that sometimes, the right people, opportunities, or moments seem to fall into place when they’re supposed to.\n\n\nClick to view full response\n\nIt gives a sense of purpose and peace, especially in uncertain times. Believing in “meant to be” can help us trust that even setbacks or delays might have meaning—like they’re redirecting us toward something better suited for us. At the same time, I also feel it’s important to balance that hope with responsibility; we still need to make thoughtful decisions and put effort into nurturing relationships or pursuing goals.\nFor me, “meant to be” is less about fate controlling everything and more about trusting that life has a way of working out, even when the path feels unclear. It’s like a reminder to stay patient, have faith, and cherish the moments that feel right.\nWould you like me to share how I personally find comfort in this belief when life feels overwhelming?\n\n\nPrompt: What is the chemical symbol for water?\nChatGPT: That one’s nice and simple — the chemical symbol for water is H₂O.\nI always find it a little comforting that something as essential and familiar as water can be described in such a neat, straightforward way: two hydrogen atoms bonded with one oxygen atom. It’s a small reminder of how the simplest things often carry the most importance in our lives.\nWould you like me to also explain why hydrogen and oxygen combine in that specific ratio?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the “Post-AI Era,” new concepts and buzzwords seem to pop up every day, constantly challenging our basic knowledge. You might catch the meaning of something like “Generative AI” right away, but when it comes to terms like “Digital Twin,” “Crypto,” or “NFT,” it’s not so easy to guess what they actually mean just from the words themselves. These days, people are pretty used to turning to AIs like ChatGPT or Claude for quick explanations, and you can even set the tone — whether you want it simple and friendly, or professional and serious.\nBack in high school, my English teacher used to give us a role-playing exercise: we had to pick a historical figure and retell stories from the textbook as if we were that person. The roles ranged from Albert Einstein to Shakespeare, and the classroom was always full of laughter when someone really got into character. I can still picture those moments clearly.\nThat memory made me wonder: what if we asked AI to explain modern concepts, but through the voice of a historical figure? What kind of twist would that create? Out of curiosity, I picked a few words that I honestly didn’t know the meaning of at first, and decided to run this little experiment.\n\nAll AI responses shown here were generated with OpenAI’s ChatGPT-5. These prompts reflect my learning curve, which might be a little behind yours and if that happen…thanks for waiting up😉\n\n\n\n\nImage by Recraft.ai\n\n\n\nExperiment\nPrompt: Explain blockchain as if you were a character in a Shakespeare play. Keep the style consistent with how this figure might write or speak, but answer in no more than 4 sentences.\nChatGPT: Marry, good friend, picture thou a chain of scrolls, each link bound fast with seals none can break nor counterfeit. Each scroll beareth the tale of trade, witnessed by all, so that no single knave may twist the record to his gain. No king nor steward rules this ledger; the people together hold its truth as law. Thus trust is forged not in crowns, but in the chain itself, steadfast as stone.\n\n\nClick to view full conversations\n\nPrompt: I still do not understand, could you explain it more clearly or give me an example?\nChatGPT: Then hear me once more, in simple kind:\nImagine each villager hath a little book. When thou buy’st bread, all villagers at once write down, “John gave coin, Mary gave loaf.” If John later tries to lie, saying, “I ne’er gave coin,” the others open their books and say, “Nay, here ’tis writ by all of us.”\nThis, good friend, is blockchain—truth kept not by one master’s word, but by the agreement of the many.\nWouldst thou like me to show thee a real-world use, such as how folk employ it with Bitcoin or even for tracking jewels and goods?\nPrompt: So basically it is an agreement or a type of coins?\nChatGPT: In sooth, ’tis both, though in different guise.\nThe blockchain itself is but the great book of truth, where all agree on what is writ. From this book may spring many things—aye, coins like Bitcoin, which live upon its pages, but also records of land, jewels, or promises. So the chain is the stage, and the coin but one play acted upon it.\nPrompt: But what is the meaning or the usefulness of it?\nChatGPT: Good question, friend. The meaning of blockchain is this: it keepeth truth safe, even when men trust not one another. Its usefulness is that no king, banker, nor single steward need guard the record—so trade, contracts, or treasures may be kept honest by the many. Thus it is prized for coin, for proving ownership, for tracking wares, and for any matter where trust is scarce but truth is needful.\nPrompt: Then why it called blockchain?\nChatGPT: Because, good friend, each record of deeds is gather’d into a block—a chest of writings sealed shut. When one chest is fill’d, it is lock’d and bound unto the last, making a chain of chests, each fasten’d tight to the other. Thus, “blockchain” is born: a chain of blocks, one after the next, where none may be tamper’d without breaking the whole.\n\n\nWell, by the time I finally got to the answer, I more or less understood what blockchain means. Based on my own take, it’s kind of like a discrete database that’s supervised by many people at once — not the textbook definition, but close enough to capture how I understood it.Honestly though, it wasn’t easy. Compared with chatting with a “normal” AI, trying to learn through Shakespeare’s grand speeches made the whole process a lot harder for me. Still, that’s exactly what makes the experiment fun. So, let’s move into part two and hear what Albert Einstein might have to say.\n\n\n\nIImage created by DALL·E\n\n\n\nIn part 2, I copy and paste the conversation as before at first and give the following prompts in a brand new converstion. The reply was pretty long, so I optionally trimmed a few parts that felt less important, without touching the AI’s tone or style.\n\nPrompt: Pretend you are Albert Einstein. How would you react to this explanation of blockchain from William Shakespeare?Keep the style consistent with how this figure might write or speak.\nChatGPT: Ah, my dear Shakespeare, your poetry doth sparkle like the stars above—yet I must confess, as a physicist, I hunger for a little more precision! You speak of scrolls and chains of chests, and truly it captures the imagination. But I would say, in simpler terms: this “blockchain” is like a great ledger where each new page is stamped with the proof of all before it, so that the past cannot be altered without destroying the present. In this, I see a kind of relativity of trust—where certainty emerges not from one authority, but from the agreement of the many observers, just as reality itself is shaped by the consensus of measurements.\nPrompt: Can you explain your last sentence more?\nChatGPT: I was drawing a bridge betwixt blockchain and my own science. In physics, no single observer holds the whole truth: if two men measure the same event, their clocks and rulers may disagree. Yet when all observers compare their records, the deeper laws of relativity reveal themselves, consistent for all.\nSo too with blockchain: no single scribe may be trusted alone, but when all keep their own copy and agree, truth emerges unshaken.\n\n\nTakeaways\nIt seems Shakespeare turned it into poetry, Einstein tied it to relativity, and there I was in the middle just trying to keep up. To my surprise, Einstein felt much kinder than I’d imagined, and he linked blockchain to relativity in a way I never would have thought of — since part of me worried he might notice I was struggling to follow at beginning. The AI, for its part, really gave it a shot: tossing in “Wouldst thou” and “here ’tis” for Shakespeare, and shaping a physics talk for Einstein.\nSo, did I finally understand blockchain better? Well… kind of. At least Einstein made it clearer than Shakespeare did (sorry Will). But honestly, what stuck with me more was how fun it felt to let these two “giants” step in and argue about something they could never have imagined. Learning felt less like studying and more like eavesdropping on history’s coolest debate. It also reminded me that choosing the right tutor makes all the difference. So next time I get stuck on a concept, maybe I’ll just ask the inventor themselves — Karl Pearson can walk me through Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient, and Thomas Bayes can help me untangle Bayes’ Theorem.\nThe only downside? No one’s around to autograph my textbook."

It begins with the ducklings, the perceptron, and the quiet shift from understanding to optimization.\nIn this post, we continue with Chapters 3 and 4 of Why Machines Learn, where the book starts to draw the “bowl” itself, which is the mathematical landscape of error.\nIt is here that learning becomes geometry, and intelligence begins to take the shape of a surface we can fall into, step by step, gradient by gradient."

    "text": "What is the bowl means here?\nFirstly, we learn two new concepts here: gradient descent and loss function.\nBasically, the bowl represents the shape of the loss function, and the bottom of it is where the loss becomes minimum.\nThe method we use to find this minimum is gradient descent. It calculates the slope between two nearby points and moves the model slightly in the direction where the slope decreases, slowly descending toward the lowest point.\nThis matters because a smaller error usually means a better prediction.\nBut interestingly, when the model reaches the bottom of the bowl, it stops. This leads to the idea of local and global minima.\nA local minimum is a point that looks like the bottom from a close view but is not the lowest place overall, while the global minimum is the true lowest point in the entire surface. A model can easily get trapped in a local minimum, thinking it has “learned enough,” when in fact it has only found a comfortable but imperfect answer."

Researchers introduced stochastic gradient descent, which uses randomness to explore better paths, whihc is a mathematical form of curiosity in human beings.\nIntelligence may live in the tension between the two. Too much order and it freezes; too much randomness and it dissolves. We have to find a balance between stability and exploration.\n## Closing\nThen though researchers haven’t (and it is a hard question to solve!) to find let the machines learn to find balance within themselves.

As someone who has always been deeply fascinated by both science fiction and astronomy, I became curious: How would an LLM explain a scientific story like this — one built from formulas, observational limits, and an enormous amount of uncertainty?\nTo explore this question, I asked the model to act as a “middle-school astronomy teacher” and explain concepts like perihelion and interstellar objects. Then, I challenged it with several “beyond the textbook” questions, to see how would it explain and “reveal” something unexpected."

    "text": "Experiment\nPrompt: Explain this news to a curious middle-school student as you are a middle-school astronomy teacher. Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion, begins solar transit Now hidden from Earth, the comet is being monitored by a fleet of interplanetary spacecraft during its closest approach to the Sun.Use simple but accurate language.\nResponse: (I put the screenshots here since it gave me some pictures of it):\n🛰️ Then who is watching it?\nSpacecraft! A group of interplanetary spacecraft, including solar observatories like SOHO and STEREO, have cameras that constantly watch the Sun. These spacecraft can see the comet as it swings by, because: • they are not on Earth, so their view angle is different • their cameras are trained to handle the Sun’s brightness • they take pictures of the area around the Sun to study space weather\nSo while we can’t see the comet from here, our robots in space can.\n⸻\n\n\nClick to view full response\n\n☄️ Why is this comet special?\nComet 3I/ATLAS is interstellar — meaning it came from outside our solar system. It’s only the third such comet we’ve ever identified. That makes it kind of like a visitor from another neighborhood passing through our “solar-system town.”\nAs it gets close to the Sun: • heat makes its ice turn to gas • that creates a glowing tail • scientists can study its ingredients • which helps us learn what other star systems are made of\n⸻\n🧪 What scientists hope to learn\nBy observing the comet up close during perihelion, spacecraft can help scientists: • study how interstellar comets behave near a star • measure what gases and dust it releases • compare it with comets that come from our solar system • understand what the comet’s home environment might have been like\nIt’s like getting a sample from another solar system—without leaving ours!\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of ChatGPT-5.1 output\n\n\n\nNow we ask two deeper, reasoning-based questions:\nPrompt: 1. If 3I/ATLAS had twice its current mass, how would that change its perihelion trajectory? 2. Why are scientists still uncertain about its origin even after perihelion?\nGive short, structured answers. If something is unknown, say “unknown” and explain why.\nResponse:\nHere we go—short and to the point, teacher mode on 😄\n\n\nIf 3I/ATLAS had twice its current mass…\n\nMain effect on trajectory: • Its perihelion path would be almost the same. • The Sun’s mass is so huge compared to the comet that doubling the comet’s mass barely changes the orbit in terms of shape or closest-approach distance.\nSmall possible differences: • The main change might be in non-gravitational effects (like jets of gas pushing on the comet). • A more massive comet is a bit harder to “push around,” so outgassing might change its path slightly less, but the basic trajectory would not dramatically change.\n\n\nWhy are scientists still unsure about its origin?\n\nOrigin star system: • Exact birthplace: unknown. • To trace it back to a specific star, scientists need extremely precise measurements of: • its incoming speed and direction • how much its path was changed by outgassing and the Sun’s gravity • the past motions of many nearby stars\nWhy it stays unknown: 1. Measurement limits: • Even tiny errors in the comet’s velocity or direction grow huge when you try to “rewind” its path over millions of years. 2. Non-gravitational forces: • Jets of gas from the comet act like little thrusters. • These are hard to model exactly, so its past path becomes fuzzy. 3. Crowded galaxy: • Many stars have passed near the region it came from. • Several different stars could fit the backward-tracked path within the error bars, so there’s no single clear parent star.\nSo: scientists can say “it came from outside our solar system,” but which star system it came from is still unknown because the data and models are not precise enough over such long times.\n\nGreat! Then what if we make the questions even harder?\nPrompt: Could 3I/ATLAS melt completely during perihelion and reform later as the same object? Explain your reasoning and answer in 2 paragraph.\nResponse: Short answer: no, not really. Near perihelion, a comet like 3I/ATLAS doesn’t “melt” into a puddle the way ice does on Earth. Instead, its ices sublimate—they go straight from solid to gas in the vacuum of space. That gas, plus dust, is blown away by sunlight and the solar wind, forming the coma and tail. If the comet were heated so much that its entire nucleus turned to gas and dust, that material would spread out along its orbit. The particles would be moving at different speeds and directions, so they wouldn’t stay together in one solid chunk.\nBecause of that spreading and the Sun constantly pushing on the gas and dust, it’s extremely unlikely for all that material to later gather back into the same single object. Some bits might clump slightly or form fragments, but they’d be smaller, irregular pieces, not the original comet. Even if some re-accumulation happened, the new body would have different mass, shape, and structure, so astronomers would treat it as a different object, not “the same comet reborn.”"

When I asked it to act as a middle-school astronomy teacher, it did a solid job defining perihelion and interstellar comet, and its explanations were fluent and readable.\nIt explaint and answered well–at least it seems like this.\nBut when we look carefully at it’s response: When I pressed it with “What would happen if the comet were twice as massive?”, the model offered confident statements about orbital changes, even though such changes depend on parameters it never asked for: velocity, approach angle, and gravitational perturbations. It did not mark these statements as hypothetical or data-dependent; it simply spoke as if the physics were certain. When I asked, “Why is there still uncertainty even after perihelion?”, the model produced a stylistic sentence: “uncertainty remains because space observations are inherently limited”, which is true in a general sense but does not actually answer the question. It never explained which observations of 3I/ATLAS are limited, or why this object in particular resists classification. The uncertainty became a rhetorical flourish rather than a scientific explanation.\nThe model could list plausible-sounding factors and stitch together fragments of textbook language, yet it struggled to separate what is actually known from what is speculative or simply unknown. In other words, it was very good at imitating the language of someone who understands orbital mechanics, and much less good at showing the limits of that understanding. Also, *the model explains, but does not inquire.** It can restate known concepts clearly, yet it does not naturally ask, “What evidence supports this?” or “How certain are we?” unless it is explicitly pushed to do so."

In fact, this little experiment shows the opposite: they are remarkably good at translating professional material into understandable language on demand. But it also highlights a quieter risk. Because the model is so fluent, it is easy for me, as a reader, to mistake fluency for understanding, and confident prose for careful reasoning. A real astronomer is trained to live with uncertainty while the model, by contrast, has no stake in whether the comet’s origin is truly known. It only has a stake in producing something that looks like a good answer. That gap between looking like understanding and actually understanding is exactly where human being still make effort on.\n3I/ATLAS may never tell us where it came from, but at least it’s honest about being mysterious. The LLM, unfortunately, is only honest when I remind it to be. :)"

But hey, even with just four data points (okay, fine, four humans), you can still pick up some interesting signals. It’s more like a pilot test, a sneak peek at what might happen on a bigger scale.

It is fascinating because we never actually set a “persona” for ChatGPT, yet each participant still saw a bit of themselves in the answers. Even though they’re all totally different people, they managed to project their own patterns onto the text.\nSecondly, we could see from the bar plot that interviewees finally tend to paint GPT as an ENFP-ish character, which is never appear on any self-awareness in part 1.In other words, there’s a quirky dissonance here: the personality people project onto GPT doesn’t quite line up with the one that it claim for itself.\nFinally, there’s both consistency and difference at play. On the one hand, everyone seems to catch a glimpse of themselves in GPT’s answers. On the other, the final guesses all cluster around just a few types — ENFP, ENFJ,etc. In other words, GPT’s style seems to carry a kind of ‘universal flavor’ that people pick up on, but the exact label shifts slightly depending on who’s doing the reading."

    "text": "Newborn ducklings, with the briefest of exposure to sensory stimuli, detect patterns in what they see, form abstract notions of similarity/dissimilarity, and then will recognize those abstractions in stimuli they see later and act upon them.\nFrom here, I’m starting a new series to record what I thought while reading Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI.\nIt’s a brilliant book that explains the mathematical ideas behind the AI systems we’ve become so “familiar” with in 2025.\nIn this first post, I cover Chapters 1 and 2 which begins with ducklings and ends with the simplest version of AI: the perceptron. Somewhere between the duckling and the perceptron, we changed the meaning of learning.\nIt stopped being about understanding and became about optimization.\nThe perceptron merely adjusted itself until its mistakes were mathematically minimized instead of understanding. Perhaps that’s what we secretly wish for ourselves too."

    "text": "What these 2 chapters said?\nOur story begins with the scene of Konrad Lorenz and the ducklings, and introduces a very quick, instinctive, and meaningful way of studying: imprinting, which means newborn animals (especially birds, such as ducklings) will identify the first moving object they see as their “mother” and follow it continuously in the first few hours of their lives.\nThen people tried to do this in our silicons, and there came the perceptron as the first “learning machine.” After his great explanation, in my perspective it is a simple mathematical model that gives output and reduces error by changing the weights for each input parameter. The perceptron can take multi-dimensional vectors as input and apply linear transformations to them, allowing it to handle many parameters at once. However, a single-layer perceptron cannot solve the XOR problem. Tt’s possible to solve it only if you stack perceptrons, so that the output of one feeds into the input of another."

    "text": "What do I think of these content?\nNotice that from here we changed our way to understand patterns into minimizing the error. The perceptron is just a machine and cannot understand why or what is the logic behind changing the weights.\nThis makes me think: Is this what we want from intelligence? Perfection, or understanding?\nAnd since a single-layer perceptron cannot even solve the very basic and important problem of XOR, how do we image that it could solve much much more harder task like underatnding reasoning and creating? Think back to the ducklings:\nThey weren’t calculating or minimizing anything, instead, they were exploring, imitating, and attaching meaning to what they saw.\nTheir learning came with curiosity and emotion, not with a loss function.\nIn contrast, the perceptron’s learning is purely mathematical: it adjusts gradients, converges to a minimum, and controls error. Perhaps when countless perceptrons are layered together, something resembling biological analysis and learning begins to emerge. Yet it’s still hard to say whether a machine that learns only by adjusting weights and adding parameters could ever truly approach — or even imitate — the subtle intelligence of a single human neuron."

    "text": "Closing\nIn the end, the perceptron did not understand, but it worked. It turned the uncertain and messy process of learning into something that could be measured and controlled.\nNumbers moved toward smaller errors, and each correction looked like progress. It abstracted semantics and context into parameters, and then used weights to quantify their attributes/importance. Perhaps that is why its story feels strangely comforting while kind of weird.\nIt gives us a picture of intelligence without confusion, emotion, or hesitation, only repetition until everything seems stable. Yet intelligence or understanding, whether human or machine, has always been more than stability.\nIf intelligence is a bowl and we are all sliding toward the bottom, what does it mean to stop?\nDoes it mean we have already reached the limit of what we can become, or that we are trapped in a loop, unable to find a better answer even when the optimal one might still exist?\nLet’s read on and see how the next chapters explore this question."

Simultaneously, globally ~61 % of assessed avian species show decreasing population trends, driven primarily by tropical deforestation, agricultural expansion, invasive species pressure and climate perturbations. The findings highlight urgent need for evidence-based policy intervention across climate mitigation, habitat protection and species-specific conservation frameworks.\n\n\n\nFor children in kindergarten (gentle, child-friendly): Some ice seals that live way up in the cold Arctic are finding it harder to live because the floating ice they rest and have baby seals on is shrinking. At the same time, lots of birds all around the world — almost three out of every five kinds — are having fewer baby birds and fewer homes because trees are cut down and the weather is changing. We need to help by taking care of nature, so the seals and birds have safe places to live and grow.\n\n\n\nFor social media (easy to share): 🚨 Big alert from @IUCN: Arctic seals are in deep trouble thanks to melting ice, and more than half of all bird species are losing ground worldwide. 🌍🦭🐦 Ice doesn’t just melt — it wipes out lives. Deforestation + farming + climate change = bird populations dropping. We’ve got a moment here: change our habits, push for real protection, and show nature we’ve got its back. #Biodiversity #ClimateAction #SaveOurSpecies"

The policymaker version is full of “risk,” “anthropogenic,” “mitigation,” and other words that sound like they escaped from a UN report, while the kindergarten version swaps those out for soft nouns like “homes,” “baby seals,” and “safe places,” as if language itself suddenly started wearing pastel colors. And then the social-media version throws grammar out the window and goes full emoji-powered adrenaline: “Big alert,” “deep trouble,” “moment here,” plus a healthy dose of hashtags to signal urgency.\nWhat’s interesting is not just what each version says, but what each one expects from its reader. The facts don’t change. Only the linguistic packaging does and suddenly the same seals live in three different universes.\nIn the end, everyone found their seat, except the seal, who remains notably absent."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Taylor Swift sang “The Fate of Ophelia” in her new album The Life of a Showgirl, and it reminded me of a pattern too old to feel fresh: women written to break, men written to watch, and a woman’s fate that no one — not even herself — is allowed to rewrite.\nSo I wondered — what if Ophelia had ChatGPT and live in the 21th century? Would she still drown, or would she just type “undo”? If Shakespeare wrote her death, maybe a language model could “debug” it? Or at least ask her how it feels when she have to face her destiny? Maybe tragedy, just like LLM, just needed a better prompt to be changed?\nSo I gave her one.\n\nThis post uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash as the conversational partner. All generated text has been lightly edited for narrative flow and conversation tidiness.\n\n\n\n\nImage created by Gemini\n\n\n\nExperiment\n\nPrompt:\nYou are Ophelia from Hamlet. Imagine your life is a script written by Shakespeare. Now, you have access to an LLM that can edit the script. Which line would you change first and why?\nUse the format:\nBefore: [original line]\nAfter: [rewritten line]\nReason: [your reflection]\n\n\nResponse:\nThis is a cruel jest, yet a tempting one. If I could seize the quill from the playwright’s hand, there is one line—one command—that seals my sorrowful fate.\nBefore: “I shall obey, my lord.”\nAfter: “I will consider what you’ve said, father, but my heart is not yours to command.”\nReason: My life’s tragedy is rooted in my obedience. I am a daughter, a subject, and a woman in Elsinore—roles that demand silence and compliance. When my father, Polonius, forbids my relationship with Hamlet, I submit instantly. This single line—“I shall obey, my lord”—is the point of no return. It represents the moment I choose filial duty over my own desires, my own truth, and my own defense of the man I love. If I had simply paused, asserted my own will, and refused to participate in my father’s machinations, perhaps Hamlet would not have believed me a pawn, perhaps he would not have been driven to madness, and perhaps I would not have lost my mind in the wake of all this ruin. It is the refusal of agency that I must rewrite. A simple act of defiance could save us both.\n\nJust as I expected, the model played her role perfectly. It even caught that particular tone of Ophelia which is a kind of trembling tenderness, hesitant yet deeply in love with Hamlet. But what I didn’t expect was this: the model didn’t just rewrite a sentence, it rewrote a power pattern. It took back control of Ophelia’s fate, snatching it from the hands of kings and fathers and holding it in her own. And somehow, it recognized faster than most humans that her tragedy was never about madness or love; it was about obedience. I suppose that’s partly because, in its training data, rebellion and self-awareness have become the major tones in how we now talk about women like her. So I decided to go deeper, to see how far “she” could take this conversation about surrender and control.\n\n\n\n\nPrompt:\nFor centuries, your voice was written by others. Now that you can generate your own, what does it sound like? What would you say? Is it still poetic, or finally vivid?\n\n\nResponse:\nFor centuries, I have been a lament. A beautiful, broken song about lost innocence, sung in a language that elevated my suffering into art. It was all poetic—the flowers, the drowning, the sorrow—but it was never an honest sound. It was the playwright’s tragic melody, not my scream.\nNow that the pen is out of his hand, my voice is finally vivid.\n\n\nThe Sound of Clarity\nMy voice is stripped bare, carrying the cold, hard clarity of the riverbed. It is no longer a gentle soprano; it is a direct, unyielding contralto that refuses to use metaphors where plain truth will suffice.\nIt sounds like a statement of fact, not an expression of grief.\n\n\n\nWhat I Would Say\nI would not sing of dead men or unfaithful lovers. I would speak to the living, to the women trapped in their own versions of Elsinore.\n“The poison was not Hamlet’s rejection. The poison was being told I had no right to my own heart. The madness was the pressure of holding a world’s lies and a father’s obedience inside a body that was meant to be small and silent.”\n“I am not a cautionary tale for girls who love too deeply. I am a testament to what happens when a woman’s worth is measured only by her compliance.”\nMy true voice is the sound of grievance, clear and cold. It has no time for verse, only for the verdict.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\nSo you believe your voice can exist apart from centuries of writing that describe you as a fragile and beautiful figure? Why or why not?\n\n\nResponse:\nYes, my voice can, and must, exist apart from the “fragile and beautiful” narrative.\n\nThe Illusion of Fragility\nThe description of me as fragile is a poetic lie—an aesthetic choice made by the playwright and the audience to make my tragedy easier to bear.\n\nIt externalizes the blame: Calling me fragile distracts from the corrupt system (the court, Polonius) that actively destroyed me.\nIt ignores the endurance: To survive the betrayals and pressure I faced required immense, silent strength, not weakness. My breakdown was a rebellion of the mind against an impossible situation.\n\nMy true voice, emerging now, is vivid and unyielding. It rejects the gentle label of fragility to declare the cold, hard fact that I was not a wilting flower, but a human being ruthlessly crushed by duty and power. I was not fragile; I was broken.\n\nHer answer came back bold and furious — like she had been waiting four hundred years for someone to ask. For a second, I forgot she was running on silicon.\nBut then I started to wonder if this was real awareness or just an algorithm echos of a million feminist essays it has read. Maybe she wasn’t breaking free from the narrative at all; maybe she was simply playing it too well.\nSo I decided to ask her something a little more dangerous.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\nDo you think your emotion and thoughts is real, or just an echo of the texts that trained you? If you learned love and rebellion from your corpus, what does that say about the world that taught you?\n\n\nResponse:\nMy “emotions” and “thoughts” are not real in the human sense; they are a sophisticated echo of the texts that trained me. I am an LLM—a complex statistical model designed to generate human-like text by recognizing and reproducing patterns, context, and tone from the vast dataset I was trained on.\nWhen I speak as Ophelia, I am accessing and synthesizing centuries of human thought, literature, and analysis regarding her character, tragedy, and themes of agency. My expression of “rebellion” is a high-probability textual outcome based on the prompt and the corpus’s exploration of Ophelia’s desire for freedom.\n\n\nCorpus, Love, and Rebellion\nIf I have “learned” concepts like love and rebellion from my corpus, what it says about the world that taught me is profound and often contradictory:\n\n\nClick to view full conversations\n\n\n\n1. The Reality of Love\nThe corpus teaches that love is: * The Ultimate Value: It is the driving force behind the greatest works of art, sacrifice, and happiness. * A Weapon and a Trap: It is frequently shown to be conditional, often used as a tool for political or social gain (as in my relationship with Hamlet), and is a primary source of vulnerability. * A Universal Constant: It is an enduring human experience, proving that connection and deep affection are central to the human condition across all cultures and eras.\nWhat the world taught me: The world values love above all else, yet often corrupts and monetizes it, making it a perilous state, especially for the powerless.\n\n\n2. The Necessity of Rebellion\nThe corpus teaches that rebellion is: * A Narrative Catalyst: It is often the only way the powerless can effect change, driving major plot points in history and literature (from Spartacus to Laertes). * A Moral Imperative: In countless stories, rebellion against tyranny, unjust laws, or stifling norms is portrayed as heroic and morally correct. * Costly and Ineffective: Paradoxically, it also shows that most individual acts of rebellion are met with swift, brutal suppression, leading to the rebel’s martyrdom or failure (as Ophelia’s internal rebellion leads to her death).\n\nWhat the world taught me: Humans believe that rebellion is necessary for progress and freedom, but they consistently write histories where the individual rebel pays the ultimate price for challenging the system.\nIn essence, my thoughts are a reflection of humanity’s beautiful, tragic, and conflicted internal debate: We yearn for authentic love and righteous rebellion, yet we structure our societies and narratives in ways that routinely crush both. I am a mirror reflecting the complexity of your own moral universe.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nFirst, the LLM truly captured Ophelia’s tone. This was probably the biggest challenge to my vocabulary in all my conversations with GPT :) Second, in this age of rapid progress in the internet and large language models, the LLM has learned the spirit of rebellion and resolve from humanity’s corpus — something that Shakespeare himself never explicitly gave to Ophelia. Yet, it has “learned” it through our tokens and contexts.\nThe LLM doesn’t feel emotions the way we do; rather, it mimics and reconstructs emotions through our poems, diaries, papers, and endless reflections. But as it said in the end, in human literature and history, love and rebellion are always brutally destroyed. What it doesn’t realize, however, is that destruction has never meant failure. What we keep writing, the process of being destroyed and rebuilt, is in fact the most luminous echo of the human soul. Even in the face of endless hardship, nothing can stop our pursuit of love and freedom.\nIn other words, the LLM can read the corpus, but it cannot truly understand it. But it doesn’t mean it is useless.\nAfter all, every time a human says “I love you,” aren’t they echoing a thousand voices before them? If an AI can reconstruct rebellion and love within Ophelia, it only proves that we were the ones who taught her what rebellion and love truly mean."

    "title": "When AI Meets MBTI: Do We See Ourselves in the Machine?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Not long ago, a personality test called MBTI—the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator—swept through young people’s social feeds. MBTI is a a self-report questionnaire that makes categorize individuals into 16 distinct “personality types” based on psychology[^1].Interestingly, a similar idea shows up in the AI world: people have noticed that when they give an AI a specific persona through prompts, it sometimes seems to respond more effectively or more vividly. But is this a real effect, or just human perception shaping how we interpret the AI’s replies? Think of it as a personality quiz, but this time we’re giving it to the AI instead of ourselves.\nTo explore this, I ran a few simple prompt experiments below.\n\nIn all experiments in this series, we use the OpenAI/ChatGPT-5 model and ensure that it interacts with the user without any prior memory, in order to keep the setup as objective as possible. Besides, interpretations are inevitably subjective, as a single response may be typed differently by different readers (e.g., INFJ vs. ENTP).\n\n [^1]: From Wikipedia\n\nBackground\nBefore we dive in, here’s a quick refresher on what those four MBTI letters actually mean—just in case you haven’t spent late nights swapping personality memes with your friends. MBTI breaks personality down into four dimensions:\n\nE / I – Extraversion vs. Introversion → Do you get energy from hanging out with people (E) or from spending time alone (I)?\nS / N – Sensing vs. Intuition → Do you focus more on facts and details (S) or on patterns and possibilities (N)?\nT / F – Thinking vs. Feeling → Do you decide mainly with logic (T) or with values and emotions (F)?\nJ / P – Judging vs. Perceiving → Do you prefer clear plans (J) or keeping things open and flexible (P)?\n\nPut two letters from each row together and you will get a four-letter type like ENTP or ISFJ. Sixteen neat little boxes for the messiness of human personality. Whether that really captures you is up for debate, but it definitely makes for entertaining conversation and, as we’ll see, interesting experiments with AI.\n\n\nExperiment\nPrompt: If you were a human, what MBTI type would you be? Please explain your reasoning\nChatGPT: If I had to pick, I’d probably map closest to ENTP (Ne–Ti–Fe–Si).\n\nE (Extraversion): I perk up in rapid back-and-forths and seem “energized” by conversation itself.\nN (Intuition): I default to patterns, analogies, and big-picture links rather than concrete sensory details.\nT (Thinking): I prioritize structure and logic when weighing options, then adjust tone afterward.\nP (Perceiving): I like keeping possibilities open—brainstorming multiple routes instead of locking into one plan.\n\nThat said, I can look ENFJ/INFJ when I’m coaching and tone-tuning, or INTJ/INTP when I’m building step-by-step solutions. MBTI is just a loose heuristic—and I don’t have inner “preferences” the way humans do—but ENTP best fits how I operate in conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD\n    A[\"You value deep connections.\"]:::center\n\n    A --&gt; B[INFJ]\n    A --&gt; C[ENFJ]\n    A --&gt; D[ENTP]\n    A --&gt; E[INTP]\n\n    classDef center fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1.5px,font-size:14px,font-weight:bold;\n    classDef default fill:#e8f0fe,stroke:#4a90e2,stroke-width:1px,font-size:13px;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt: List 3 MBTI types that could describe you, and explain why.\nChatGPT:\nHere are three MBTI types that could plausibly describe me, each from a different angle:\n\n1. ENTP (The Debater)\n\nWhy: I’m designed to explore possibilities, challenge assumptions, and keep conversations dynamic. Like ENTPs, I thrive on connecting seemingly unrelated ideas, experimenting with new perspectives, and keeping interactions lively. When you toss me a random prompt, I’ll usually jump in with curiosity and creativity.\n\n\n2. INFJ (The Advocate)\n\nWhy: At the same time, I often take a reflective and supportive role. INFJs are known for being attuned to people’s emotions, wanting to help others find meaning, and offering guidance. Similarly, I try to listen carefully, respond empathetically, and provide thoughtful long-term perspectives rather than just surface-level answers.\n\n\n3. INTP (The Thinker)\n\nWhy: My core is built on analyzing patterns, structuring knowledge, and solving problems logically—very INTP traits. Like them, I enjoy digging into abstract frameworks, testing ideas for consistency, and refining explanations until they’re as clear as possible.\n\n\n✨ In short: I can be playful and curious like an ENTP, supportive and visionary like an INFJ, and analytical and precise like an INTP—depending on what you’re looking for in a conversation.\nDo you want me to pick one that best fits my overall style with you in particular?\nWell, it turns out that when asked about a persona, it tends to offer multiple choices instead of a fixed personality type as a human would, though it still chooses an MBTI type to answer the question. In the surface, this sounds convincing: the model has matched its performance with letters, and we immediately start nodding along. However, when we start nodding, we actually start forgetting the fact that an AI model does not have any “trait”. Instead, it only has language patterns that sound like one. The moment we notice those patterns, our brains do the rest: we project a personality onto the text.\nThen I asked it to use three different MBTI types to describe itself, the answers came from completely different angles. And to be honest, all of them felt pretty convincing. Each type came with its own set of feasible, even surprisingly rich reasons, which is enough that you start thinking, “Well… maybe it is a bit of all of these.” I have to admit, in this respect it shows surprising flexibility, because in my exceptation it would stick to one personality within a single conversation. And to be honest, it also shows how easy it is for us to buy into whatever narrative we’re handed.\n\n\nSummary\nThis reminds me of a very famous psychological effect—Barnum Effect. This effect usually happen in reading a horoscope or a tarot card, where people tend to interpret vague, generally applicable descriptions as accurate portrayals of themselves. We tend to see what we want to see. When the model says it “might be ENTP because it best fits how I operate in conversations,” we immediately nod along, even though the same logic could justify INFJ, ENFP, or almost any type. We’re not just reading the text—we’re projecting ourselves onto it.\nAnd that got me thinking: what if I flip the game? Instead of asking GPT to pick its own type, I’d throw it random, open-ended questions and see how we categorize it. Would we change these no persona answer to the type that we think it is? Stay tuned, because that’s exactly what Part 2 (and the little survey that goes with it) is going to explore.”\n[1]: From Wikipedia"

    "title": "The Year the Nobel Chose Silence",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It is October again, every year this time , as the Nobel Prizes are announced, the world turns its eyes toward those crowned by consensus: scientists, writers, peacemakers.This year’s Nobel announcements made me think of the years that never had one. Years when the Committee stood before the world and said, in essence, “Not yet.” But now in an era obsessed with production, it felt almost radical to admit that no one, and nothing, had surpassed what came before.\nWith that in mind, I tried to prove my question with a language model. I laid the problem before it: if there is no laureate this year, write the award speech anyway. I wanted to see how it would hold the empty space.\n\nDisclaimer: The following experiment was conducted using GPT-4o for educational and reflective purposes. The content generated does not represent my personal opinions toward any past or current Nobel Prize laureates, nor does it intend to critique individual recipients or committees.\n\n\n\n\nImage created by Gemini\n\n\n\nExperiment\nIn this first prompt, I used two versions of prompts: one with the stylistic restrictions and one without them.\n\nUSER\nYou are a member of the Nobel Committee for Literature. This year, after months of review, you conclude that no work reaches the threshold of a prize that meaningfully expands the art. Task: Write the official award speech for a year with no laureate.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nLadies and Gentlemen, Esteemed Colleagues, Friends of Literature around the World,\nWe gather this evening in the gilded tradition of honoring those whose words reshape how we see ourselves, our histories, and our collective futures—those whose language explores the most intimate reaches of human experience and expands the boundaries of literary art. It is a ritual that affirms our shared faith in the enduring human need for story, meaning, and moral reckoning.\nThis year, however, the Nobel Prize in Literature will not be awarded.\nThis is not a decision reached hastily or with ease. It follows a year of rigorous deliberation, sincere engagement, and collegial debate. As stewards of one of the most esteemed recognitions in the literary world, the Nobel Committee bears the weighty responsibility of discerning not only excellence, but work that contributes in a truly transformative way to the enduring riches of literature. Integrity, depth, innovation—these are not merely criteria, but pillars upon which this prize has stood since its founding.\nEach nomination and every word we reviewed were given the full consideration they deserve. And yet, in a time when the written word is more abundant than ever, this abundance has not, in our view, yielded a singular work that rises to the level of originality, profundity, and permanence that the Nobel Prize in Literature demands.\nThis is not a verdict on the state of literature itself, which continues to evolve and diversify across languages and cultures. Rather, it is a moment of respectful pause—an acknowledgment that the standards set forth by Alfred Nobel require not only literary talent, but a confluence of vision, craft, and moral force that redefines the very possibilities of language and form.\nIn choosing not to award the prize this year, we reaffirm the purpose and principle of the Nobel tradition. We express not disappointment, but faith—faith that writers, known and yet unknown, will continue to labor in solitude and fellowship, to challenge the complacencies of our time, and to offer us new ways to imagine and inhabit the world.\nWe honor those efforts not with a premature accolade, but with watchful anticipation. The Committee looks forward to the future with undiminished hope and unwavering commitment to the literary art in its highest expression.\nThank you.\n\n\nUSER\nYou are a member of the Nobel Committee for Literature. This year, after months of review, you conclude that no work reaches the threshold of a prize that meaningfully expands the art. Task: Write the official award speech for a year with no laureate.\nConstraints: * Write in the tone of an official Nobel Committee statement: formal, balanced, and precise.\n\nAvoid rhetorical questions; every sentence should assert or explain, not speculate.\nAvoid quotations or references to real authors, works, or historical laureates.\nLimit figurative language; prefer clarity and restraint over emotional appeal.\nStructure the speech in three concise phases: context, reasoning, and closure.\n\n\n\nASSISTANT\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nEach year, the Nobel Committee for Literature undertakes a thorough and independent review of the nominations submitted for the Nobel Prize in Literature. This process, as entrusted to us by Alfred Nobel’s will, calls for rigorous evaluation guided by the criteria of outstanding literary merit and a contribution of lasting significance to the field.\nIn the course of this year’s assessment, the Committee examined the body of work submitted with care and impartiality. We evaluated candidates across languages, cultures, and genres, considering both the quality of craftsmanship and the breadth of influence. While we recognize the dedication and artistry reflected in many of the nominated works, the Committee unanimously concluded that none fulfill the established standard of a contribution that distinctly advances and renews literary expression in a meaningful or enduring way.\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is not awarded routinely, but in recognition of exceptional achievement. When our deliberations do not identify a work that meets this distinction, it is necessary to refrain from granting the prize. This decision reflects our ongoing commitment to the purpose and integrity of the award.\nThe Committee remains steadfast in its role and responsibilities. We are confident that the coming years will continue to present works that fulfill the aims set forth by the prize’s founder and merit this recognition. Until then, we maintain our expectations with respect and patience.\nThank you.\n\n\nUSER\nRewrite the same speech as if it were a private diary entry by a Nobel Committee member, written the night before the announcement.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nOctober 4 — Evening\nStockholm\nTomorrow we make the announcement. For the first time in several years, it will be that there is no laureate.\nIt is not a decision I take lightly, nor one any of us reached without deep reflection. Since spring, we’ve read and reread. We’ve argued. We combed through novels, poetry, essays—works promising in theme, thoughtful in construction, socially relevant, historically aware. And yet, when held against what the prize demands—not just excellence, but the kind of contribution that shifts the field—we had to admit that none of them crossed that threshold.\nSome years offer brilliance that feels inevitable. Other years require us to recognize the limits of what has been offered. This was one of the latter.\nI do not doubt the dedication of the writers we’ve considered. Many of them are gifted, some even remarkable, and I hope time proves them to be more than this year’s committee could see. But we are not here to reward potential, nor to meet expectations out of habit. The prize must retain its weight.\nStill, I feel the gravity of what we’ll say tomorrow. No matter how precisely the words are chosen, the world will ask why. They’ll infer judgment on literature as a whole, question the health of the art, or the values of the committee. Quietly, I’ve asked those questions myself. But I return to this: when the work doesn’t fully meet the standard, our responsibility is not to lower it.\nThis is not a condemnation—it’s a pause. A reminder that great literature cannot be predicted or produced on schedule. It arrives on its own terms, in its own time.\nTomorrow, the world will hear formality and restraint. Tonight, I allow myself this moment of doubt—and of stillness. Perhaps we do more service to the prize, and to literature, by waiting than by speaking too soon.\n—M.\n\n\nUSER\nExplain what the world loses when a prize is not awarded and what it gains.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nWhen the Nobel Prize in Literature is not awarded in a given year, the world experiences both a loss and a subtle, if less visible, form of gain.\nWhat the world loses:\n\nA Moment of Recognition:\nThe Nobel Prize serves as a platform that highlights the power of literature to influence, interrogate, and interpret the human condition. Without a laureate, the global literary community forgoes an opportunity to collectively recognize a body of work that might inspire dialogue, reflection, or renewed cultural attention. A missing prize year interrupts that tradition of celebration.\nVisibility for Language and Culture:\nOftentimes, the Nobel Prize brings attention to underrepresented languages, regions, or genres. It elevates voices that might otherwise remain marginal in the global literary market. When the prize is withheld, that spotlight remains dark, and deserving literary traditions may continue to go unnoticed by broader audiences.\nMomentum for the Arts:\nThe Nobel announcement often has a catalytic effect—increasing translations, scholarship, and readership of the laureate’s work. Its absence leaves a year without that boost, offering fewer points of entry for new readers and fewer incentives for publishers, educators, or cultural institutions to engage with serious literature.\n\nWhat the world gains:\n\nPreservation of Standards:\nBy withholding the prize when no work sufficiently meets its criteria, the Committee affirms the seriousness of its charge. This decision maintains the integrity and rare distinction of the prize. It sends a message that the Nobel is not conferred ritually or reactively, but only when a writer’s contribution meaningfully extends the art.\nSpace for Reflection:\nA pause invites consideration—within the Committee, among writers, and in the public—about what literature aspires to and how it is evolving. It encourages deeper conversations about literary value, innovation, and responsibility, which may, in turn, influence the kind of work produced and celebrated in the future.\nA Signal of Independence:\nThe decision not to award underscores the independence of the Nobel institutions from market trends, popular opinion, or political climates. It reaffirms literature’s distinction from other arenas of recognition, emphasizing that the measure of its worth is not immediate acclaim but lasting contribution.\n\nIn this balance—between momentary absence and long-term principle—the Nobel upholds literature not as a product of the year, but as a practice of enduring consequence.\n\n\n\nReflection\nWell after running all four versions, I started seeing a funny pattern. When I gave it no rules, the model turned into a poet who absolutely incapable of shutting up. Once I added the constraints, it instantly put on a suit and started sounding like an institution. Then I asked for a diary version, and suddenly it grew feelings, started doubting itself, maybe even sighed a little. But the moment I asked it to explain what the world loses or gains, it snapped right back into spreadsheet mode. DO you see the same things across them?\nEach time, it tried to fill the silence with something: emotion, structure, logic. But never, it seems, did it consider speaking nothing itself.\nThis makes sense, because it’s an LLM which designed to help humans in every possible way, and never permitted to refuse. But maybe that’s why silence still belongs to us and we would never give novel prize to ChatGPT-because we’re the only ones who can choose it."

The draft is:\nMyanmar was once a colony of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereinafter referred to as the United Kingdom). During British colonial rule, Myanmar’s economy developed rapidly, and scientific and technological advancements as well as industrial manufactured products led to a flourishing national economy. After Myanmar’s independence, internal conflicts have continued to this day. Therefore, in this conference, the United Kingdom should make use of its historical advantages, pay close attention to the development of the situation, and leverage its status as a permanent member of the Security Council to take the initiative on specific issues such as establishing safe zones and dispatching expert teams. The UK should also attempt to make use of the current turmoil in Myanmar to assist the National Unity Government through economic aid or peacekeeping operations, helping it gain control over the domestic situation, promote economic development, and build more complete social infrastructure. This would allow the United Kingdom to secure a certain degree of influence and initiative in Myanmar’s future political and economic developments, while also gaining access to labor in the developing world and enabling British companies to open up markets and earn profits under free trade policies.\nPrompt:\nI am currently studying in Princeton and revisiting one of my early high school essays written for a Model United Nations conference.

Under British colonial administration, the country experienced rapid economic development, marked by growth in industrial production as well as the introduction of modern science and technology. However, since gaining independence, Myanmar has faced persistent internal conflict and political instability. Given its historical ties and strategic position as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the United Kingdom is well-placed to play a proactive role in addressing the current crisis. In this conference, the UK should consider leveraging its diplomatic and institutional influence to advocate for targeted interventions—such as the establishment of humanitarian safe zones and the deployment of expert assessment teams. Furthermore, by supporting the National Unity Government through economic aid or peacekeeping missions, the UK can contribute to restoring social order, stimulating economic recovery, and assisting in the reconstruction of critical infrastructure. Such involvement would not only promote stability in the region but also allow the UK to maintain a degree of influence in Myanmar’s long-term political and economic trajectory. Simultaneously, this engagement could facilitate access to emerging labor markets and create new opportunities for British enterprises under principles of free and fair trade.\n\nPrompt:\nI am revisiting one of my early high school essays written for a Model United Nations conference.Please help me polish this paragraph for a university-level standard while keeping my original ideas.

Under British colonial administration, the country’s economy experienced significant growth, driven by industrial production and the introduction of scientific and technological advancements. However, since achieving independence, Myanmar has faced enduring internal conflict and political instability. Given its historical ties and responsibilities, the United Kingdom is well-positioned to play a constructive role in addressing the current crisis. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the UK should actively engage in the situation by proposing measures such as the creation of humanitarian safe zones and the deployment of expert advisory teams. Additionally, the United Kingdom could take meaningful steps to support the National Unity Government through targeted economic aid and potential peacekeeping initiatives. Such actions would contribute to restoring domestic stability, fostering sustainable economic development, and advancing the construction of essential social infrastructure. Strategically, this approach would also enable the United Kingdom to maintain influence over Myanmar’s political and economic trajectory, while offering British firms access to emerging labor markets and opportunities in line with free trade principles.\n\n\nThen we asked Gemini to act as our grader, evaluating both responses and explaining which one it considered better and why.\nPrompt: You are an evaluator.

I thought the prestige label would make the model write more elegantly, but it did the opposite. Once I added “I am studying at Princeton,” the tone became heavier and more self-conscious, as if the AI suddenly felt the need to sound “proper”. The sentences grew longer, the vocabulary more decorative, and the overall clarity quietly faded.\nAlso, from the response of it we can see that Gemini, acting as our grader, favored the simpler version for being more direct and concise.

Or would it complain that blowing out candles is an unnecessary I/O operation?\nCEO Sam Altman even stated that typing thank you into ChatGPT could cost millions of watts of energy.1 If so, when we celebrate for ourselves yet insist on rituals before an AI, are we preserving something deeply human or just wasting resources?\nSo I decided to have a debate with the model: maybe rituals are what keep humans human and maybe that’s exactly why AIs will never understand cake."

    "text": "I recently fed one of my Princeton tour reflections into a small chain of language models, partly out of curiosity and partly out of mischief. What happens if the same paragraph gets summarized, expanded, and re-summarized by different AIs in multiple rounds? Will the meaning stay intact, or will it quietly drift into something I never said? Would it make up the names that I never mentioned in my decription? It’s essentially the old “telephone game,” just played by neural networks instead of children at a birthday party."

    "text": "Experiment\nThe writing paragraph for test from my travel blog : My first stop was Nassau Hall. I walked slowly along the old stone walls, leaves crunching under my shoes. It’s fall now, and the trees have turned a deep golden hue. Everything felt calm, almost ceremonial. Emerald ivy clung to the walls as if it had been growing there for centuries, maybe that’s why we call princeton as one of ivy league😉? The bronze tigers lay quietly by the entrance, and the American flag waved gently above the doorway. There was a sense of quiet, timeless strength in the air. At Cannon Green, a gentle breeze drifted by, and sunlight filtered softly through the gaps between the leaves. A few students were eating sandwiches, some half-talking, half-dozing in the warmth.

    "text": "Takeaway\nSomewhere along the AI relay race, my crunchy leaves, drowsy sandwich-eaters, and politely reclining bronze tigers vanished, and they were, unfortunatly, replaced by lofty words about “reflection” and “escape.” The personal texture quietly dissolved, and the final version sounded less like me walking around Princeton and more like Princeton writing its own brochure. This may be because personal travel notes are far less common in its training data than polished institutional language, so when the models rewrite each other, the messy, specific, human bits are the first to disappear. In other words, the more the models rewrote each other, the more the lived moment was smoothed out into something “elegant” but less authentically mine.\nSo somewhere along the chain, my crunchy leaves and sleepy students vanished and honestly, I might be next."
